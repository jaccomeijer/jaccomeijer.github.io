## Asset security context

The post below on asset security is about the information systems that process,
transfer or store data. This post is about the data in that context.

## Data identification

Data generally grows steadily within organizations. Newly added data has
significant impact on organization security which makes it important to identify
new data. The more is known about the new data, the better it can be protected.

### Data roles

All data should have an owner to ensure proper data governance. The diagram
below shows the relationship between data roles, capabilities and the relevant
requirements.

> The diagram uses 'data asset' to describe the value of the data. This

> 'data'.

## Data classification

Data classification is assigning a value and a sensitivity level based on
content and context. Data categorization is grouping the classified data.

Classification is important because treating security risks for all data equally
is a costly approach. It is much more efficient to classify data on sensitivity
and differentiate accordingly.

### Data classification

Data classification is always best practice but is usually only formalized in
strongly regulated environments like military, governments and banks.

With every newly introduced cyber security law however, data classification
becomes increasingly important for all organizations.


### Data classification types

Data classification can be divided into three primary types.

|  Classification Type  |  Description  |  Examples  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Content-Based**     | Analyzes the actual data within the file or message.         | Detects credit card numbers, PII, or sensitive keywords in documents. |
| **Context-Based**     | Uses metadata or environmental factors around the data.      | Classifies based on file location, sender/receiver, or access patterns. |
| **User-Based**        | Relies on user roles, behavior, or manual input.             | User selects classification label; defaults based on department or role. |

## Conclusion

Understanding data is a foundational aspect of data security. As organizations
continues to generate and handle increasing volumes of data, identifying and
classifying this data becomes essential for maintaining cyber security.

Assigning clear ownership and applying appropriate classification methods
enables organizations to manage risks more efficiently and comply with evolving
regulatory requirements.

By treating data as a valuable asset and aligning roles and responsibilities
accordingly, organizations can ensure that their data governance and protection
strategies are both effective and scalable.
