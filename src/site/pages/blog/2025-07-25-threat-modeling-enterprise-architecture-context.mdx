## Earlier posts

This post ties together three earlier posts on security frameworks and threat
modeling by using the frameworks and threat modeling in Enterprise Architecture
(EA).

## Conclusions from earlier posts

- ISO 27001 and NIST CSF can reliably be used together and risk management
  is an essential part of both
- Both standards do not mandate how to manage risk
- Threat modeling is a way to achieve the context based risk management
  described by both standards
- The standards describe that managing security risks is a collaborative effort
  and how this should be a foundational element of an organization. This
  collaborative effort is at the core of the threat modeling culture.

## Enterprise Architecture (EA)

Both the observatory nature of threat modeling and the holistic nature of
Enterprise Architecture contribute to improved risk management.

Threat modeling helps by collaboratively modeling new threats and treatments. EA
helps by relating the elements of risk to the holistic view of the enterprise.

Observing and modeling risks related to motivation, strategy, business goals,
the application landscape and the technology used, is an enormous strength.

## Open Agile Architecture (O-AA)

Technology changes, threats change, EA should change accordingly. Because of the
growing need for enterprise agility in the digital age [The Open
Group](https://www.opengroup.org) introduced [Open Agile
Architecture](https://www.opengroup.org/AgileArchitecture) late 2020.

## EA in a threat modeling culture

A threat modeling culture combined with EA adds to awareness and to formally
sharing security details. It adds to consistent methods and when threat modeling
becomes part of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) threat modeling adds
to the feedback loop as described in the fourth NIST CSF tier.

Studying all four NIST CSF tiers closely shows that threat modeling increases
cyber security by adding maturity to all four tiers.

### Enterprise Risk and Security Management (ERSM)

The strength of Archimate (3.2 Specification) is in the layers and the 60
elements. The six layers enable modeling a holistic view of an enterprise.

The diagram below is an Archimate model for modeling risk. The three aspects of
risk are modeled in red around the risk element:

1) threat (business event),
2) vulnerability (assessment) and
3) loss (business event) represents the asset.

The green elements show how the risk relates to a security control objective
(goal), a security control measure (requirement) and a security principle.

With the risk defined, the vulnerability element can used to model risk by
associating the element to any of the 60 Archimate elements. Below an example
where the interface (e.g. HTTP instead of HTTPS) contains the vulnerability.

This example uses the application layer to model the risk, but other layers are
equally useful. The technology layer for example, is usable for modeling
specific technology vulnerabilities and a vulnerability in a business process as
another example, can be modeled on the business layer.

### Risk assessment elements

The diagram uses risk assessment elements as outlined in the post below.

## Conclusion

Threat modeling helps by collaboratively modeling new threats and treatments.
The holistic view EA provides helps by relating the elements of risk to
motivation, business goals, the application landscape and the technologies in
use.

The post below details all 60 Archimate (3.2 Specification) elements which all
can be used to model risk. That way, a modeled holistic view of an enterprise
becomes even more valuable than it already was.

Fast moving technology introducing new threats constantly asks for architecture
agility. Hence the reference to [Open Agile
Architecture](https://www.opengroup.org/AgileArchitecture) in this post.
