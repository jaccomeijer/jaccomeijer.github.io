## Who uses ArchiMate?

In the post below about the ArchiMate language the question 'who uses this
language?' comes up. The short answer here is IT architects. The long answer is
this post.

## IT architects

This list of IT architect roles is long. This post started with the Chief,
Enterprise and Solutions roles in mind but the list is longer.

## Archimate perspective

From an ArchiMate perspective, the roles could be simple. A motivation
architect, a strategy architect, a business architect, an application architect
and a technology architect. The motivation or strategy architect overseeing the
full architecture.

## TOGAF perspective

[The Open Group](https://www.opengroup.org) maintains a Framework for Enterprise
Architecture known as TOGAF. The core of this framework is the TOGAF
Architecture Development Method (ADM).

The TOGAF ADM can be mapped to the Archimate layers as shown below. The colors
in the diagram match the Archimate layers above.

## The model

In real life, IT architect roles do not follow the ArchiMate abstraction nor do
the roles follow the TOGAF ADM. Many roles exist and depending on the context
the expected activities vary.

This post uses the example roles from the TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills
Guide (10th edition). The guide uses the three TOGAF viewpoints for managing an
enterprise architecture landscape to describe architect roles:

- A complete **enterprise** and its overall structure
- Specific **segments** (relevant elements) of the enterprise that have
  coherence and can be governed and evolved effectively
- Specific **solutions** that utilize the components within the segments to
  remove, change, or introduce new solutions and their associated sub-systems,
  systems, and services

The model below relates these viewpoints to the the four TOGAF defined architect
roles: chief, enterprise, segment and solutions architect.

## Specialists

Besides the four TOGAF defined architect roles, the segments viewpoint shows
three groups of specialists. Business specialists on the left, application, data
and technology specialists on the right. A similar division is found in the
TOGAF architecture Roles and Skills Guide.

The two groups on the right mimic the ArchiMate layers on the bottom. Likewise
the group on the left could be divided if needed.

## TOGAF defined roles

The TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills Guide contains detailed descriptions of
these roles.

All architects focus on delivering services and solutions. Below how the role
varies in the level of abstraction and specificity. As a general rule all
architects work closely together.

### Chief architect

Chief architects communicate concepts and ideas to all executives and are
responsible for gaining their commitment. They lead all architects on the
highest level and provide strategic alignment.

### Enterprise architect

Enterprise architects work with senior stakeholders, they define architectural
principles and oversee governance.

### Segment architect

Larger enterprises have segment architects that handle segments of the
enterprise architecture.

They are responsible for the capabilities of a segment.

### Solution architect

Solution architects collaborate with business and specialist stakeholders. They
make sure solutions meet requirements and ensure desired business outcomes. Part
of that responsibility is that they oversee architectural and solution building
blocks.

## Security architect

The model defines a security architect for all three specialist groups. This is
because security is a broad area. The CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK)
divides the profession into eight domains.

1) Security and risk management
2) Asset security
3) Security architecture and engineering
4) Communication and network security
5) Identity and access management
6) Security assessment and testing
7) Security operations
8) Software development security

Actual security architecture is covered by domain 3. But all domains can be
mapped to specific ArchiMate layers. More on this in the post below.

## Specialists

A specific architect for a specific task. This makes sense, but this
also results in many different architect roles.

### Brief specialist role overview

|Role|Modeling|Aligns model with|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Business architect |Business strategy and process|Technology strategy and process|
|Compliance architect|Compliance objectives, measures and risks|Business requirements and IT processes|
|Application architect|Behavior and integration of software applications|Requirements on usability, scalability, performance and maintainability|
|Software architect|Structure and behavior of software applications|User requirements|
|Data architect|Data and data flows|Security objectives and governance|
|Infrastructure architect|Physical and virtual technology infrastructure|Requirements on availability, recovery, and performance|
|Network architect|Physical and virtual network systems|Requirements on security, scalability and efficiency|
|Cloud architect|Cloud computing strategies and architectures|Requirements on security, scalability and efficiency|
