## Risk analysis for software development

In the world of software development risk is inevitable. Whether it's shifting
project requirements, security vulnerabilities or integration challenges,
identifying and managing these uncertainties early can mean the difference
between success and failure.

Risk assessments provide a structured approach to uncover potential issues
before they escalate, helping teams make informed decisions, allocate resources
effectively and maintain project momentum.

This post explores all steps of risk analysis of the SDLC. From the
identification of risk to mitigate the risk by implementing controls.

## Identify Risk

The first step in risk analysis is to identify potential risk events. These
events are specific situations or conditions that could negatively affect the
SDLC.

A productive starting point is to conduct brainstorming sessions with
stakeholders, team members and subject matter experts. This collaborative
approach helps surface a wide range of risks based on diverse perspectives and
experience.

To organize the process and ensure comprehensive coverage, it’s helpful to group
risks into categories. The table below contains few examples.

| Risk event category       | Examples                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical**             | Unfamiliar technology, scalability issues, integration difficulties, legacy system constraints, performance bottlenecks, technology stack limitations |
| **Project Management**    | Poor planning, scope creep, unrealistic timelines, inadequate risk management, changing requirements, lack of project visibility                      |
| **People (Team)**         | Inexperienced staff, lack of communication, key person dependency, high turnover, insufficient training, low team morale                              |
| **External**              | Vendor delays, regulatory changes, third-party API failures, geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, changes in market conditions         |
| **Organizational**        | Budget cuts, shifting priorities, lack of stakeholder support, internal politics, organizational restructuring, resource reallocation                 |
| **Security & Compliance** | Data breaches, non-compliance with GDPR, weak authentication, insecure data storage, lack of encryption, inadequate audit trails                      |
| **Code**                  | Poor code quality, lack of automated tests, high technical debt, inconsistent coding standards, low test coverage, fragile legacy code                |
| **Data**                  | Inaccurate data, data loss, poor data migration, inconsistent data formats, lack of data governance, stale or outdated datasets                       |

To enhance this step, AI can assist by generating context specific risk
categories and scenarios.

Identifying and categorizing risks is the foundation for assessing how likely
these event will occur and how serious their consequences can be.

## Assess likelihood

This step focuses on the probability that risk will materialize. The likelihood
of risk gives a clearer picture of the exposure and where attention is most
needed.

With clarity on likelihood, the next step is to consider how serious each risk
is.

## Assess impact

Serious risk is risk with a high potential impact. Impact can be measured in:

- quantitative terms, such as financial cost;
- qualitative terms, such as delays, reduced quality or customer dissatisfaction.

The product of likelihood and impact gives a good understanding of the severity
of the risk. This is what is used in the next step to prioritize the risk.

## Prioritize risk

The most important risk is the risk with both a high likelihood and a high
impact. Prioritizing risks means ranking them by how serious the risk is.

High priority risk is the risk that needs the most attention.

## Risk treatment

Risk without any action taken is called inherent risk. Any risk remaining after
treatment is known as residual risk.

For inherent risk this step applies an appropriate treatment strategy. The aim
is to reduce or manage the risk to an acceptable level. The table below provides
a high level overview of common risk treatments and how they are applied.

| Evaluation                                                 | Treatment | Example Action                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk exceeds acceptable threshold                          | Avoid     | Discontinue the activity, technology or process entirely |
| Risk can be reduced cost-effectively                       | Mitigate  | Implement technical or procedural controls (see below)    |
| Mitigation is not cost-effective                           | Transfer  | Outsource, use insurance or shift risk to cloud service  |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost-effective or feasible | Accept    | Document the risk, monitor it and proceed with awareness |

Avoiding, transferring and accepting risk is left out of the scope of this post.
The next step for this post is to mitigate risk by implementing controls

## Mitigate by implementing controls

In practice, selecting which controls to implement is guided by a cost benefit
analysis. Evaluating the security improvements that each control offers to the
SDLC compared to the resources required to implement them.

The post below outlines the common controls for a SDLC that is structured with
the DevSecOps approach.

## Monitor and review

Risk management doesn’t stop at implementation but continues by monitoring risk
throughout the SDLC. Because of the permanent nature, a risk register is useful
for tracking all identified risks.

## Conclusion

Risk analysis is a critical foundation for successful software development. By
systematically identifying and assessing potential risks, teams can reduce
uncertainty and prevent costly issues.

This proactive approach provides a strategic advantage, enabling the delivery of
reliable, secure and high-quality software.
