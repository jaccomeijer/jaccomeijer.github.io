## Risk assessments for software development

The foundation for this post is in the post below.

## Identify Risk

In risk analysis, a risk is typically evaluated by assessing two factors:
likelihood and impact.

Likelihood refers to the probability that a risk event will occur, while impact
represents the potential consequences or losses if the risk materializes.

Start by brainstorming and listing all potential risk events. These can fall
into several categories. Use AI to generate event categories for your specific
use case.

| Risk event category       | Examples                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical**             | Unfamiliar technology, scalability issues, integration difficulties, legacy system constraints, performance bottlenecks, technology stack limitations |
| **Project Management**    | Poor planning, scope creep, unrealistic timelines, inadequate risk management, changing requirements, lack of project visibility                      |
| **People (Team)**         | Inexperienced staff, lack of communication, key person dependency, high turnover, insufficient training, low team morale                              |
| **External**              | Vendor delays, regulatory changes, third-party API failures, geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, changes in market conditions         |
| **Organizational**        | Budget cuts, shifting priorities, lack of stakeholder support, internal politics, organizational restructuring, resource reallocation                 |
| **Security & Compliance** | Data breaches, non-compliance with GDPR, weak authentication, insecure data storage, lack of encryption, inadequate audit trails                      |
| **Code**                  | Poor code quality, lack of automated tests, high technical debt, inconsistent coding standards, low test coverage, fragile legacy code                |
| **Data**                  | Inaccurate data, data loss, poor data migration, inconsistent data formats, lack of data governance, stale or outdated datasets                       |

## Assess likelihood and impact

From these risk events, assess the likelihood that the event occurs and the
impact of the risk. The impact can be assessed in:

- quantitative terms, such as financial loss (measured in currency), or
- qualitative terms, such as the severity of the effect on project objectives
  (e.g., time, quality, or customer satisfaction).

This approach helps prioritize risks and determine appropriate mitigation
strategies.

## Prioritize risk

The risk is calculated by multiplying likelihood and impact. The calculated risk
is then used to prioritize the risk.

## Mitigate risk

Once inherent risk is identified and evaluated, appropriate treatment strategies
are applied. These aim to reduce or manage the risk to an acceptable level. Any
risk remaining after treatment is known as residual risk. The table below
provides a high-level overview of common risk treatments and how they are
applied.

For each high priority risk, plan one or more of the following:

| Evaluation                                                 | Treatment | Example Action                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk exceeds acceptable threshold                          | Avoid     | Discontinue the activity, technology, or process entirely |
| Risk can be reduced cost-effectively                       | Mitigate  | Implement technical or procedural controls (see below)    |
| Mitigation is not cost-effective                           | Transfer  | Outsource, use insurance, or shift risk to cloud service  |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost-effective or feasible | Accept    | Document the risk, monitor it, and proceed with awareness |

## Monitor and Reassess

In software development risk analysis, it's essential to continuously monitor
and reassess risks throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Maintain a risk register to document identified risks and track risk regularly
using risk logs or dashboards. As the development evolves, review and update
risk assessments to reflect any changes. Assign clear ownership for each risk to
ensure accountability and timely response.

## Implement controls

When a risk has a high likelihood or significant impact but both can be reduced
through cost effective measures, it becomes a candidate for mitigation. In this
case, the goal is to lower the probability of the risk occurring or reduce its
impact by implementing appropriate controls as outlined in the post below.
