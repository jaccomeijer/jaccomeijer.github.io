## Identify Risk

Software risk is defined by the probability of a negative event occurring during
the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) combined with the potential impact of
that event.

Start by brainstorming and listing all potential risks. These can fall into
several categories. Use AI to generate categories for your specific use case.

| Category                  | Examples                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical**             | Unfamiliar technology, scalability issues, integration difficulties, legacy system constraints, performance bottlenecks, technology stack limitations |
| **Project Management**    | Poor planning, scope creep, unrealistic timelines, inadequate risk management, changing requirements, lack of project visibility                      |
| **People (Team)**         | Inexperienced staff, lack of communication, key person dependency, high turnover, insufficient training, low team morale                              |
| **External**              | Vendor delays, regulatory changes, third-party API failures, geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, changes in market conditions         |
| **Organizational**        | Budget cuts, shifting priorities, lack of stakeholder support, internal politics, organizational restructuring, resource reallocation                 |
| **Security & Compliance** | Data breaches, non-compliance with GDPR, weak authentication, insecure data storage, lack of encryption, inadequate audit trails                      |
| **Code**                  | Poor code quality, lack of automated tests, high technical debt, inconsistent coding standards, low test coverage, fragile legacy code                |
| **Data**                  | Inaccurate data, data loss, poor data migration, inconsistent data formats, lack of data governance, stale or outdated datasets                       |

## Assess and prioritize risk

Use qualitative and/or quantitative methods to determine:

- likelihood, how likely is the risk to occur?
- impact, what would be the effect on the project if it happens?

The risk is calculated by multiplying likelihood and impact. The calculated risk
is then used to prioritize the risk.

## Mitigate risk

For each high priority risk, plan one or more of the following:

| Evaluation                                                       | Treatment | How                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk exceeds a threshold                                         | Avoid     | Stop using a specific technology or behavior                    |
| Likelihood or impact can be reduced with cost effective measures | Mitigate  | Implement controls (more on that below)                         |
| Mitigation is not cost effective                                 | Transfer  | Shift risk onto a 3rd party by e.g. insurance or cloud services |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost effective                   | Accept    | Be aware                                                        |

## Monitor and Reassess

In software development risk analysis, it's essential to continuously monitor
and reassess risks throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Maintain a risk register to document identified risks and track risk regularly
using risk logs or dashboards. As the development evolves, review and update
risk assessments to reflect any changes. Assign clear ownership for each risk to
ensure accountability and timely response.

## Implement controls

When a risk has a high likelihood or significant impact but both can be reduced
through cost effective measures, it becomes a candidate for mitigation. In this
case, the goal is to lower the probability of the risk occurring or reduce its
impact by implementing appropriate controls as outlined in the post below.
