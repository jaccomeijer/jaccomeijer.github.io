## Secure Controls Framework

The post below on how to align the steadily increasing number of security
standards refers to the [Secure Controls
Framework](https://securecontrolsframework.com) (SCF) as an example. This post is
about how to use the SCF canonical control objectives with Enterprise Risk and
Security Management (ERSM) in Archimate.

## Setup SCF

Using the SCF can save a lot of time because it brings ready to use STRM
relationship documentation and it improves in terms of efficiency, but SCF is
not a commercial off the shelf solution. Because frequent misunderstanding, SCF
provides what the SCF is not in the official documentation. In summary:

> `NOT` A substitute for performing due diligence and due care, `NOT` A complete
  technology or documentation solution to address all your cybersecurity & data
  privacy needs and `NOT` A solution guaranteed to meet every compliance
  requirement of your organization

SCF has extensive documentation on setting up  a Cybersecurity & Data Privacy
Risk Management Model. Before assessing the likelihood and impact of risk in
detail it requires in depth risk analysis first. This includes setting up risk,
threat and controls catalogs.

## SCF Meta model

Figure 3 in <a href={blogOpenerByNavId(props,
  'iso-27000-isa-62443-nis2-bio-nist-csf-800-53').action.url}>this post on
  security standards</a> models all elements of the SCF.
  
Figure 1 shows an updated version of the same model with some changes:

- all technology elements are moved together;
- the threat catalog is linked to the SCF control;
- the loss element, representing the likelihood that the risk occurs is moved
  outside of the SCF

## Modeling risk and security

> Risk is the probability that a threat exploits a vulnerability and impact is
the possible asset value loss. In a quantitative way when measured in currency
and in a qualitative way when evaluating importance.

Adding threats and vulnerability to assets modeled in Enterprise Architecture is
a good way to understand risk. Especially for complex risk, visualizing the
relationships helps assessing risk.

When inherent risk is evaluated and likelihood or impact can be reduced with
cost effective measures the canonical controls come into play. The table below
shows other possible risk evaluation outcomes.

| Evaluation                                                   | Treatment | How                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk exceeds a threshold                                     | Avoid     | Stop using a specific technology or behavior                 |
| Likelihood or impact can be reduced with cost effective measures | Mitigate  | Implement controls                                           |
| Mitigation is not cost effective                               | Transfer  | Shift risk onto a 3rd party by e.g. insurance or cloud services |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost effective                 | Accept    | Be aware                                                     |


## Archimate modeling with SCF

Modeling archimate with SCF requires the SCF components to be available as
archimate elements. Figure 1 shows that these components are:

- the threat catalog;
- the risk catalog;
- the principle sets;
- the SCF control objectives.

When the catalog solution and the archimate model solution are not the same,
interfacing is needed to make the catalog available to the model solution.

For example, the Bizzdesign model solution is able to interface with the IT
management platform ServiceNow. Another example on the Bizzdesign platform is
setting up an Excel connector.


## Example model

Figure 2 shows an archimate model of a simple web application that uses SCF to model risk.

This view leaves out the principle sets as well as many of the SCF internal
relationships as modeled in figure 1. The view focuses on these elements:

- Loss: connects threat and risk, the loss event represents the probability that
  the threat event exploits the vulnerability;
- Vulnerability: connects the elements that contain the weakness with the threat
  and relates the threat to the SCF objective.
- Measure: is realized by the technology elements that secure the vulnerability.

## Cyber security standards

Figure 1 shows control measures from standard y and control objectives from
standard x. This is to illustrate that some security standards contain mainly
objectives, like ISO 27001 and NIST CSF 2.0. Whereas other standards contain
merely measures. ISO 27002 and NIST SP 800 53 are good examples of the latter.

The example in figure 2 uses a control measure. The measure is realized by the
mTLS solution. Depending on the use case, the choice is to either use the
measure from the standard or to leave the measure out and have the mTLS solution
realize the SCF control objective directly.

Same choice for the influence relationship that decreases the vulnerability.
This can be modeled from the control objective, the control measure or both.

For risk assessment both choices make little difference. Depending on an audit
for a specific standard you might need to model accordingly. Think of the
evaluation of which measures from a standard have a realized-by relationship.


## Traffic lights and heat maps

Some Enterprise Architecture solutions have integrated risk properties like
vulnerability level and threat capability for qualitative risk analysis. These
property values are often displayed as traffic lights next to the Archimate
elements.

Evaluating risk with properties allows for e.g. security heat map representations.

## Conclusion

This short post is mainly about the two example models. Figure 1 can be used as
a SCF meta model and figure 2 shows how to add risk assessment and risk
treatment.

The models in this post are kept simple and risk management for these models is
mainly overkill. For organizations that use the holistic security approach
however, models like these add great value.
