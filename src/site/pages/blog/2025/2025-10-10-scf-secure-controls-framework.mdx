## Secure Controls Framework

The post below on how to align the steadily increasing number of security
standards refers to the [Secure Controls
Framework](https://securecontrolsframework.com) (SCF) as an example. This post is
about how to use the SCF canonical control objectives with Enterprise Risk and
Security Management (ERSM) in Archimate.

## SCF Meta model

Figure 3 in <a href={blogOpenerByNavId(props,
  'iso-27000-isa-62443-nis2-bio-nist-csf-800-53').action.url}>this post on
  security standards</a> models all elements of the SCF. Figure 1 shows an
updated version of the same model where all technology elements are moved to the
bottom of the model.

## Setup SCF

Using the SCF can save a lot of work because it improves in terms of efficiency,
but is by no means an of the shelf solution. This is a summary of what the **SCF
is not** from the official documentation:

>  A substitute for performing due diligence and due care

> A complete technology or documentation solution to address all your cybersecurity & data privacy
needs

> A solution guaranteed to meet every compliance requirement of your organization

TBW: Using the SCF needs proper setup. 

## Cyber security standards

TBW: Standards contain either objectives, measures or both.

## Vulnerability influence

Influence from measure, control or both.

## Vulnerabilities, threats, objectives and measures

TBW:  All measures defined, how are the measures realized

## Risk analysis

TBW: Assessments
