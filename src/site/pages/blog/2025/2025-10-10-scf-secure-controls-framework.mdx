## Secure Controls Framework

The post below on how to align the steadily increasing number of security
standards refers to the [Secure Controls
Framework](https://securecontrolsframework.com) (SCF) as an example. This post is
about how to use the SCF canonical control objectives with Enterprise Risk and
Security Management (ERSM) in Archimate.

## SCF Meta model

Figure 3 in <a href={blogOpenerByNavId(props,
  'iso-27000-isa-62443-nis2-bio-nist-csf-800-53').action.url}>this post on
  security standards</a> models all elements of the SCF. Figure 1 shows an
updated version of the same model where all technology elements are moved to the
bottom of the model.

## Setup SCF

Using the SCF can save a lot of time because it improves in terms of efficiency,
but is by no means a commercial off the shelf solution. A summary of what the
SCF is not from the official documentation:

> `NOT` A substitute for performing due diligence and due care, `NOT` A complete
  technology or documentation solution to address all your cybersecurity & data
  privacy needs and `NOT` A solution guaranteed to meet every compliance
  requirement of your organization

SCF has extensive documentation on setting up  a Cybersecurity & Data Privacy
Risk Management Model. Before assessing the likelihood and impact of risk in
detail it requires in depth risk analysis first. This includes setting up risk,
threat and controls catalogs.

## Modeling risk and security

> Likelihood is the probability that a threat exploits a vulnerability and
impact is the possible asset value loss. In a quantitative way when measured in
currency and in a qualitative way when evaluating importance.

Adding threats and vulnerability to assets modeled in Enterprise Architecture is
a good way to understand risk. Especially for complex risk, visualizing the
relationships helps assessing risk.

When inherent risk is evaluated and likelihood or impact can be reduced with
cost effective measures the canonical controls come into play. As can be read
from the table below.

| Evaluation                                                   | Treatment | How                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk exceeds a threshold                                     | Avoid     | Stop using a specific technology or behavior                 |
| Likelihood or impact can be reduced with cost effective measures | Mitigate  | Implement controls                                           |
| Mitigation is not cost effective                               | Transfer  | Shift risk onto a 3rd party by e.g. insurance or cloud services |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost effective                 | Accept    | Be aware                                                     |


## Example model

Figure 2 shows a simple web application example with a canonical SCF control
objective and a control measure from a security standard.

It does not show all the components of risk that are modeled in figure 1. The
vulnerability, the threat and the asset are present which are all relevant for
assessing risk.

The risk treatment part shows the solution that realizes the measure, the
control objective and the control measure.

## Cyber security standards

Figure 1 shows control measures from standard y and control objectives from
standard x. This is to illustrate that some security standards contain mainly
objectives, like ISO 27001 and NIST CSF 2.0. Whereas other standards contain
merely measures. ISO 27002 and NIST SP 800 53 are good examples of the latter.

The example in figure 2 uses a control measure. The measure is modeled to be
realized by the mTLS solution. Depending on the use case, the choice is to
either use the measure from the standard or to leave the measure out and have
the mTLS solution realize the SCF control objective directly.

Same choice for the influence relationship that decreases the vulnerability.
This can be modeled from the control objective, the control measure or both.

For risk assessment both choices make little difference. Depending on an audit
for a specific standard you might need to model accordingly. Think of the
evaluation of which measures from a standard have a realized-by relationship.


## Traffic lights and heat maps

Some Enterprise Architecture solutions have integrated risk properties like
vulnerability level and threat capability for qualitative risk analysis. These
property values are often displayed as traffic lights next to the Archimate
elements.

Evaluating risk with properties allows for e.g. security heat map representations.

## Conclusion

This short post is mainly about the two example models. Figure 1 can be used as
a SCF meta model and figure 2 shows how to add risk assessment and risk
treatment.

The models in this post are kept simple and risk management for these models is
of course overkill. For organizations that use the holistic security approach
however, models like these can be of great value.
