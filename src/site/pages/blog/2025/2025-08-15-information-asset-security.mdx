## Asset security

Data security can be seen as a specialization of asset security which is what
the post below is about.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'data-security')} swapImage={true} />

## Information assets

Assets in this post are information systems. Systems that processes, transfer or
store data. From a security perspective an asset is any system that has value.
These assets can be tangible, intangible and logical.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|--|--|--|
| Tangible         | Physical assets that can be seen and measured                | hardware, network infrastructure |
| Intangible       | Non-physical assets that represent value                     | software, databases, information stores |
| Hybrid / Logical | Information assets that are logical or part tangible and part intangible | networks, information systems |

## Asset identification

Assets are added and removed from organizations frequently. These changes have
significant impact on organization security which makes it essential to identify
new assets. The more is known about the new assets, the better the assets can be
protected.

Because of the importance and the complexity of managing all assets in a large
organization, a broad variety of tooling is used.

Scanners, directories, license trackers, discovery services, etc. All contribute
to asset identification. AI helps by handling large amounts of data and
analysis.

### Asset security roles

All assets should have an owner to ensure proper asset governance. Across the
most popular security frameworks, many roles exist.

| Role | Organizations |
|---|---|
| Risk Executive | NIST |
| Information Security Officer (ISO, CISO) | NIST, ISO |
| Asset Owner | ISO, ISA/IEC, ISACA |
| Application Owner | NIST |
| System Owner | NIST |
| System Integrator | ISA/IEC |
| IT Asset Manager | NIST |

## Asset management

Because of the many tools that work together identifying assets, all information
should be consolidated into a single source of truth managed by a single
authority. This concept leads to the specific field of IT Asset Management
(ITAM).

The major goals of ITAM are more broad than only the cyber security context:

- Reduce costs by avoiding over-purchasing and under-utilization
- Ensure compliance with software licensing and regulatory requirements
- Improve operational efficiency and decision-making
- Support cyber security by maintaining accurate asset inventories

> ISO 19770 is a family of international standards focused on ITAM. It provides
frameworks and specifications to help organizations manage their IT assets such
as hardware, software, subscriptions and cloud services effectively and in
compliance with governance and licensing requirements.

## Asset classification

Asset classification is assigning a value and a sensitivity level based on
content and context. Asset categorization is grouping the classified assets.

It is common to value an asset in two ways. The quantitative value is the
estimation of the numerical asset value and the qualitative value is the
assessment of an assets importance or impact.

Classification is important because treating security risks for all assets
equally is a costly approach. It is much more efficient to classify assets on
sensitivity and differentiate accordingly.


### Asset classification Levels

AI is very suitable for scaffolding text. This is an example AI prompt on
setting up asset classification levels.

```md
create an Asset classification levels table:
- rules:
  - use tiers where tier 0 is the most restricted
  - include mixed tier
  - include example systems and devices
  - include description
  - include requirements
  - output visual markdown table
```

#### Generated asset classification levels table

| Tier | Description | Example Systems/Devices | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | Most restricted. Critical assets with highest confidentiality, integrity and availability needs. | Core banking systems, encryption key vaults, national ID databases | Multi-factor authentication, Strict access control, Real-time monitoring, Encrypted storage |
| Tier 1 | Highly sensitive. Important for business continuity and compliance. | HR systems, financial reporting tools, internal legal databases | Role-based access, Regular audits, Secure backups, Patch management |
| Tier 2 | Moderately sensitive. Operational systems with limited exposure risk. | CRM platforms, internal collaboration tools, inventory systems | Standard authentication, Periodic vulnerability scans, User training |
| Tier 3 | Low sensitivity. Public-facing or non-critical systems. | Company website, marketing tools, public documentation portals | Basic security hygiene, Monitoring for anomalies, Regular updates |
| Mixed Tier | Assets spanning multiple tiers due to integrated functions or shared infrastructure. | Hybrid cloud environments, shared databases, mobile device fleets | Segmentation controls, Tier-specific policies per component, Continuous risk assessment |


### How organizations classify assets

Key regulations and frameworks define how organizations classify and categorize
information assets, often shaping their asset identification and protection
policies.

Below an example AI prompt that generates an overview of common regulations on
asset classification for jurisdictions EU, USA and China.

```md
create a matrix:
- rows:
  - GPDR (EU)
  - NIS 2 (EU)
  - NIST SP 800-60 (USA)
  - FIPS 199 (USA)
  - FISMA (USA)
  - MLPS (China)
  - PIPL (China)
- columns:
  - classify
  - category
- cells: summarized search results in text 
- rules:
  - generate 5 variants for each term and log them
  - also search for variants
  - limit search to official regulation text
  - output markdown table that can be copied
```

#### Generated regulation sources table

| Regulation           | Source URL                                                   |

#### Generated asset classification regulations matrix

|  Framework                 |  **Classify**                                                                              |  **Category**                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **GDPR (EU)**             |  Used in guidance for security levels (e.g., EU RESTRICTED), not in the core regulation.  |  Defines “special categories” of sensitive personal data (e.g., health, race).                 |
|  **NIS 2 (EU)**            |  Refers to classifying entities by criticality (essential vs. important).                 |  Entities are grouped into categories that determine obligations and oversight.                |
|  **NIST SP 800-60 (USA)**  |  Implies classification through mapping data to impact levels.                         |  Central concept: categorizing data by confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.   |
|  **FIPS 199 (USA)**        |  Classification not used; focuses on categorizing systems by impact on security objectives.  |  Defines categories based on impact levels for confidentiality, integrity and availability.   |
|  **FISMA (USA)**           |  Requires categorization of systems; relies on NIST guidance, not classification terminology.  |  Uses security categories to guide risk management and control selection.                      |
|  **MLPS (CHINA)**          |  Uses formal classification levels (1–5) based on system sensitivity and national interest.  |  Categorizes systems by role and criticality to determine protection requirements.             |
|  **PIPL (CHINA)**          |  Implies classification via “sensitive personal information” requiring stricter handling.  |  Defines categories of personal data, especially sensitive types like biometrics and health data.  |

## Conclusion

Understanding and securing information assets is a foundational aspect of modern
cyber security.

Effective asset management supported by tooling, AI, ITAM and standards like
ISO 19770 ensure that organizations maintain visibility and control over their
digital landscape.

Classification and categorization of assets allow for differentiated security
measures, optimizing resource allocation and risk mitigation. Regulatory
frameworks across jurisdictions reinforce the importance of structured asset
handling, each offering unique perspectives on how data and systems should be
valued and protected.

Ultimately, mature asset management empowers organizations to safeguard their
operations, comply with regulations and respond dynamically to evolving
threats.
