## Software development security

Software security is a vital part of information security, covering everything
from development to deployment. It is complex to secure because it involves
multilayer architecture, developer behavior and the challenges of AI. Cloud
services can simplify by shifting security responsibilities to providers but
this increases the complexity of compliancy and governance.

## Software development

The long definition of software development:

> the process of designing, creating, testing and maintaining software
> applications or systems. It involves writing code, designing software
> architecture, debugging and deploying programs to meet specific needs or
> solve particular problems. This process typically follows methodologies like
> Agile or Waterfall and includes tasks like writing user stories, coding,
> testing and documentation.

And the short version:

> the full lifecycle of building software from an idea to a finished and
> functional product.

The phrase 'full lifecycle' from the short description brings the topic to that
was is known as the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC).

## Software development lifecycle

A search on software development lifecycle in the [Dutch NEN
register](https://www.nen.nl/en/) brings up two standards:

| Standard               | Title and description                                                                                           |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288     | Systems and software engineering - System life cycle processes                                                  |
| NPR 5333               | Output‑based measurement, performance management and contracting for agile software development and maintenance |

ISO 15288 is not specific for software but a common framework of process
descriptions for describing the lifecycle of systems. The SDLC process
descriptions can be combined with security considerations as defined by e.g.
NIST SP 800-160.

The Dutch NPR 5333 is a new standard (released november 2025). It is intended to
help both clients (customers) and suppliers (developers) in defining, measuring
and managing agile software projects in a objective, transparent and outcome
oriented way.

The new NPR 5333 standard is listed here because one of the development methods
in this post is Agile Scrum.

## Development methods

The SDLC covers the full process from an idea to a finished functional product
and development methods define the steps in this process. Methods differ by
prioritizing different values like speed, quality, flexibility and
documentation.

### Waterfall

One of the oldest methods is called Waterfall. Although considered outdated and
inflexible for modern software development, Waterfall is still used for many
smaller projects where little collaboration is involved.

The Waterfall method's inflexibility significantly impacts security because it
limits the ability to iteratively assess and update security requirements
throughout the SDLC.

### Agile Scrum

By the early 2000s, the software industry increasingly recognized that the
traditional Waterfall method was too rigid for the fast changing demands of
modern development. In response, the Agile Alliance in 2001 published the Agile
Manifesto from which various Agile frameworks emerged. Today, the Scrum variant
is one of the most widely adopted frameworks for software development.

### DevSecOps

Inspired by Agile practices around 2007, DevOps found its way into the world.
Its adoption is often described as a cultural shift, aiming to break down the
traditional silos between software development and IT operations. DevOps creates
a more integrated and efficient software delivery process.

A key advantage of the DevOps culture is the acceleration of software release
cycles. The increased speed however also introduced new risks by expanding the
attack surface. Largely due to the fact that many security teams remained siloed
and were only brought into the process late in the SDLC.

Another consequence of faster releases was that traditional compliance processes
were seen as obstacles, often delaying deployments due to their slow and manual
nature.

In response to these challenges, the industry began shifting toward a new
cultural model known as DevSecOps where security and compliance practices are
integrated in all phases of the SDLC.

DevSecOps promotes shared responsibility for security across development,
operations and security teams which ensures that speed does not compromise
safety or compliance.

More on the security controls for every step of this approach can be read in a
post on <a href={blogOpenerByNavId(props,

### Other methods

Agile Scrum is not the only evolution of the traditional Waterfall model. While
Scrum has gained widespread popularity for its iterative approach and emphasis
on collaboration and flexibility, other methods have also emerged to address the
limitations of the linear Waterfall process.

For example, the Spiral model introduces risk analysis and iterative development
cycles, making it more adaptable to changing requirements and uncertainties.

| Concept         | Waterfall  | Agile Scrum        | DevSecOps  | Spiral    |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :--------- | :-------- |
| **Process**     | Linear     | Iterative          | Continuous | Iterative |
| **Risk**        | Afterwards | Managed by sprints | Continuous | Central   |
| **Security**    | Afterwards | Not inherent       | Integrated | Planned   |
| **Flexibility** | Low        | High               | High       | Moderate  |
| **Project**     | Predictive | Evolving           | Evolving   | High-risk |

## OWASP

A comprehensive post on software development security should not overlook OWASP,
the Open Worldwide Application Security Project. OWASP is a globally recognized
organization that provides a wealth of security related resources, tools and
best practices for developers and security professionals alike.

## SDLC Maturity

Assessing and improving the maturity of the SDLC is critical to building
efficient and secure software systems. Several established maturity models help
organizations evaluate their current practices and guide continuous improvement:

- Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and its successor, the [Capability Maturity
  Model Integration (CMMI)](https://cmmiinstitute.com/cmmi), are foundational
  frameworks that focus on improving software development processes across the
  organization through structured levels of maturity.
- The [Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org)
  developed by OWASP, specifically targets the integration of security practices
  into the SDLC, promoting a systematic approach to building secure software.
- The [Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)](http://bsimm.com) helps
  organizations benchmark their existing software security initiatives and
  offers practical guidance for enhancing security across the development
  lifecycle.

## Security controls & Risk analysis

The two post below continue from here by defining DevSecOps security controls and
how to analyze software development risks.

## Conclusion

Software development security is a multifaceted discipline that spans the entire
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). From initial design to deployment and
beyond. As development practices evolve from Waterfall to Agile Scrum and
DevSecOps, so must security approaches. Traditional methods often treated
security as an afterthought, but modern methods like DevSecOps integrate
security and compliance throughout the entire SDLC. This promotes a culture of
shared responsibility.

The goal of software development is not just to build functional software, but
to ensure it is secure, resilient and compliant in a rapidly changing
technological and regulatory landscape.

As the industry continues to prioritize speed and innovation, aligning
development methods with robust security practices becomes not only a technical
necessity but a strategic imperative.
