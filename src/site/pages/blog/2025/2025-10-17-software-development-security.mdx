## Software development security

Software security is a vital part of information security, covering everything
from development to deployment. It is complex to secure because it involves
multilayer architecture, developer behavior and the challenges of AI. Cloud
services can simplify by shifting security responsibilities to providers but
this increases the complexity of compliance and governance.

## Software development

The long definition of software development:

> the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software
> applications or systems. It involves writing code, designing software
> architecture, debugging, and deploying programs to meet specific needs or
> solve particular problems. This process typically follows methodologies like
> Agile or Waterfall and includes tasks like writing user stories, coding,
> testing, and documentation.

And the shot version:

> the full lifecycle of building software from an idea to a finished and
> functional product.

The phrase 'full lifecycle' from the short description brings the topic to
something called the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC).

## Software development lifecycle

A search on software development lifecycle in the [Dutch NEN
register](https://www.nen.nl/en/) brings up two standards:

| Standard                                               | Title and description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288                                     | Systems and software engineering - System life cycle processes                                                  |
| NPR 5333 (Dutch only and to be released november 2025) | Output‑based measurement, performance management and contracting for agile software development and maintenance |

ISO 15288 is not specific for software but a common framework of process
descriptions for describing the lifecycle of systems. The SDLC process
descriptions can be combined with security considerations as defined by e.g.
NIST SP 800-160.

The Dutch NPR 5333 is a new standard to be released november 2025. It is
intended to help both clients (customers) and suppliers (developers) in
defining, measuring and managing agile software projects in a objective,
transparent and outcome oriented way.

## Development methods

The SDLC covers the full process from an idea to a finished functional product
and development methods define the steps in this process. Methods differ by
prioritizing different values like speed, quality, flexibility and
documentation.

### Waterfall

One of the oldest methods is called Waterfall. Although considered outdated and
inflexible for modern software development, Waterfall is still used for many
smaller projects where little collaboration is involved.

The Waterfall method's inflexibility significantly impacts security because it
limits the ability to iteratively assess and update security requirements
throughout the SDLC.

### Agile Scrum

By the early 2000s, the software industry increasingly recognized that the
traditional Waterfall method was too rigid for the fast changing demands of
modern development. In response, the Agile Alliance in 2001 published the Agile
Manifesto from which various Agile frameworks emerged. Today, the Scrum variant
is one of the most widely adopted frameworks for software development.

### DevSecOps

Inspired by Agile practices around 2007, DevOps found its way into the world.
Its adoption is often described as a cultural shift, aiming to break down the
traditional silos between software development and IT operations. DevOps creates
a more integrated and efficient software delivery process.

A key advantage of the DevOps culture is the acceleration of software release
cycles. The increased speed however also introduced new risks by expanding the
attack surface. Largely due to the fact that many security teams remained siloed
and were only brought into the process late in the SDLC.

Another consequence of faster releases was that traditional compliance processes
were seen as obstacles, often delaying deployments due to their slow and manual
nature.

In response to these challenges, the industry began shifting toward a new
cultural model known as DevSecOps where security and compliance practices are
integrated in all phases of the SDLC.

DevSecOps promotes shared responsibility for security across development,
operations and security teams which ensures that speed does not compromise
safety or compliance.

### Other methods

Agile Scrum is not the only evolution of the traditional Waterfall model. While
Scrum has gained widespread popularity for its iterative approach and emphasis
on collaboration and flexibility, other methods have also emerged to address the
limitations of the linear Waterfall process.

For example, the Spiral model introduces risk analysis and iterative development
cycles, making it more adaptable to changing requirements and uncertainties.

| Concept         | Waterfall  | Agile Scrum        | DevSecOps  | Spiral    |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| **Process**     | Linear     | Iterative          | Continuous | Iterative |
| **Risk**        | Afterwards | Managed by sprints | Continuous | Central   |
| **Security**    | Afterwards | Not inherent       | Integrated | Planned   |
| **Flexibility** | Low        | High               | High       | Moderate  |
| **Project**     | Predictive | Evolving           | Evolving   | High-risk |

## OWASP

A post on software development security cannot miss out on OWASP, a well
established name in the cyber security world. OWASP is 'Open Worldwide
Application Security Project' and offers many security related resources as
outlined by the post below.

## SDLC Maturity

Several maturity models are widely used to assess and improve Software
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) maturity:

- Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and its successor [Capability Maturity Model
  Integration (CMMI)](https://cmmiinstitute.com/cmmi) are among the oldest and
  most widely adopted frameworks focused on improving and optimizing software
  development processes across an organization.
- [Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org), developed
  by OWASP, focuses specifically on integrating security practices into the SDLC
  to ensure robust software assurance.
- [Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)](http://bsimm.com) helps
  organizations measure their current software security initiatives and provides
  guidance on how to improve security practices within the SDLC.


## Security controls & Risk analysis

The two post below continue from here by defining DevSecOps security controls and
how to analyze software development risks.
