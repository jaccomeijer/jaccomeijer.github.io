## Managing risk

Risk is a broad area and in the context of risk management, risk relates to
threats, vulnerabilities and assets.

<Picture className="s-block-space u-block-space-l" src="/site/pages/blog/images-security/risk.svg" />

For an organization to manage risk, risk needs to be identified. Once
identified, risk can be analyzed and treated.

Larger organizations manage risk by identifying as much risk at the same time
while small and medium sized businesses usually start with the first risk
identified.

Risk analysis is analyzing threats, vulnerabilities and assets. Threat modeling
being part of threat analysis.

In risk analysis, a risk is typically evaluated by assessing two factors:
likelihood and impact.

Likelihood refers to the probability that a risk event will occur, while impact
represents the potential consequences or losses if the risk materializes.

The impact can be assessed in:

- quantitative terms, such as financial loss (measured in currency), or
- qualitative terms, such as the severity of the effect on project objectives
  (e.g., time, quality, or customer satisfaction).

This approach helps prioritize risks and determine appropriate mitigation
strategies.

Once inherent risk is identified and evaluated, appropriate treatment strategies
are applied. These aim to reduce or manage the risk to an acceptable level. Any
risk remaining after treatment is known as residual risk. The table below
provides a high-level overview of common risk treatments and how they are
applied.

| Evaluation                                                 | Treatment | Example Action                                            |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk exceeds acceptable threshold                          | Avoid     | Discontinue the activity, technology, or process entirely |
| Risk can be reduced cost-effectively                       | Mitigate  | Implement technical or procedural controls                |
| Mitigation is not cost-effective                           | Transfer  | Outsource, use insurance, or shift risk to cloud service  |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost-effective or feasible | Accept    | Document the risk, monitor it, and proceed with awareness |

### Frameworks for managing risk

The ISO 31000 family is a guideline for managing risk that details a process,
principles and a framework. It is a framework that fits all types of industry
and is regulation independent. Many other frameworks like e.g. ISO 14971 for
medical devices address specific industry types and align with industry specific
regulations.

Specifically for cyber security, NIST SP 800-37 is a well known risk framework.
Two other notable cyber security specific risk standards are not frameworks but
do provide useful guidance.

- ISO 27005, provides guidance on managing information security risks
- NIST 800-30, a guide for conducting information security risk assessments

## NIST CSF

NIST CSF, with cyber security in its name is specific for the field. It is an
outcome oriented roadmap that does not mandate the how. What does NIST CSF have
on the roadmap for risk management?

### NIST CSF risk management

The first NIST CSF core function `IDENTIFY` is about the organization's current
cyber security risks. Asset management and risk management are on the roadmap
here.

The core function `PROTECT` is about treating the risk. Based on the results of
`IDENTIFY`, controls are added where needed instead of the one-size-fits-all
approach.

As expected for a cyber security framework, NIST CSF clearly has managing risk
on the roadmap. But NIST CSF has a broader scope than only managing cyber
security risk and the framework does not contain specifics on how to manage
risk.

## ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is a management system for cyber security and like NIST CSF, there is
no 'how'. What does it say on risk management requirements?

### ISO 27001 risk management

ISO 27001 requires 'Actions to address risks and opportunities' in clause 6
which details to:

- 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment
- 6.1.3 Information security risk treatment

Appendix A contains the recommended Information security controls and states
that the controls shall be used in context with information security risk
treatment (6.1.3) as mentioned above.

Two specific controls on risk management are:

- 5.7 Threat intelligence
- 5.9 Inventory of information and other associated assets

As you may expect from a cyber security management framework, ISO 27001 makes
risk management mandatory. Similar to NIST CSF the standard is broader than only
managing cyber security risk. Another similarity is that it does not contain
specifics on how to manage risk.

## Conclusion

The post below on NIST CSF and ISO 27001 states that the standards have a
different purpose, but their goals align and the standards strengthen each
other. This is in line with risk management being part of both standards.

### How to manage risk

Both standards do not mandate how to manage risk. Threat modeling is a way to
achieve this. This fits on the NIST CSF roadmap and answers to the ISO 27001
requirements. More on that in the post below.
