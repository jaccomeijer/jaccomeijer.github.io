## Security architect

The post below maps architect roles to ArchiMate layers. In that context the
post describes the security architect. A relevant certification for a security
architect is called CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional).
This post relates the domains used by the CISSP certification to the architect
roles and ArchiMate layers.

## Security architect

Security is a broad area. The CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) divides the
profession into eight domains.

1) Security and risk management
2) Asset security
3) Security architecture and engineering
4) Communication and network security
5) Identity and access management
6) Security assessment and testing
7) Security operations
8) Software development security

## The model

If there's one thing that the model makes clear, it is that security is
relevant for all layers. From strategy to technology, security is a topic.

## Cake analogy

The cake analogy is often used to explain that security should be a baked-in
ingredient instead of an add-on.

The cake analogy works well for the technology and the application layer. The
model makes clear that the analogy is relevant for the strategy and the business
layers as well.

The full enterprise architecture being the cake here. Over time every architect
should have security baked in. Until then, a separate security architect
overseeing the full architecture on security remains relevant.
