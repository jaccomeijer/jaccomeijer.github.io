## Security controls for software development

The foundation for this post is in the post below.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'software-development-security')} swapImage={true} />

## DevSecOps

In strong contrast to Waterfall, DevSecOps is a modern approach that integrates
security throughout the entire SDLC.

Outlining security controls for software development by following the DevSecOps
approach works well because security is integrated into every step of
DevSecOps.

/>

Figure 1 shows how the steps relate. Each step is outlined below and relates the
step to the relevant security controls, scrum roles, scrum events and which
controls could be added to automated CI/CD pipelines.

Controls from compliancy standards like ISO 27002 are not added but with the
help of AI, a simple basic set can be generated. For making the list more
actionable AI can also be used to generate tool recommendations.

### üîß 1 - Plan

#### Product Owner

- Assign a security champion
- Drive proper Solution Design and Architecture (SDA)
- Facilitate risk assessments
- Classify data according to sensitivity
- Oversee privacy impact assessments
- Map security governance policies (NIST, ISO, OWASP)

#### Scrum planning activities

- Threat modeling on evolving requirements
- Add security requirements to user stories
- Evaluate compliance and legal requirements
- Plan rollback and deployment strategies early
- Include security-specific acceptance criteria in stories

#### Scrum refinement activities

- Perform or update STRIDE models
- Review new threat surfaces from backlog changes

---

### üîß 2 - Code

#### Product Owner

- Enforce secure coding standards
- Provide regular security training and awareness sessions
- Enforce secure repository policies

#### Dev team

- Perform security focused peer code reviews
- Prevent hardcoded credentials and secrets
- Validate third party code components

#### Automated by CI/CD

- Run Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Use commit hooks for linting, tests, and signing

---

### üîß 3 - Build

#### Product Owner

- Enforce build integrity policy
- Support a bug bounty program
- Support Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

#### Automated by CI/CD

- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Scan for hardcoded secrets
- Automate dependency updates
- Apply policy-as-code gates
- Integrate continuous PEN test pipelines

---

### üîß 4 - Test

#### Product Owner

- Schedule manual PEN tests every N major releases
- Ensure conduction of exploratory security testing

#### Automated by CI/CD

- DAST, IAST, API Security Testing
- Chaos security tests
- Regression and fuzz testing
- Compliance and privacy policy validation

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5 - Release

#### Product Owner

- Ensure implementation of secrets lifecycle management
- Ensure validation of rollback strategy
- Ensure that release approvals are audited

#### Scrum review activities

- Conduct security review and risk sign-off
- Document and communicate security decisions

#### Automated by CI/CD

- Generate release notes with security info (CVE, CWE, OWASP Top 10)
- Ensure artifact signing and tamper checks
- Apply version tagging policies

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 6 - Deploy

#### Product Owner

- Ensure that pre-deployment image scanning is performed

#### Automated by CI/CD

- Analyze IaC for misconfigurations
- Inject secrets securely at runtime
- Zero trust security deployment practices

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 7 - Operate

#### Product Owner

- Ensure that incident response outcomes and monitoring results are fed back into the backlog
- Enforce hardened runtime environments
- Ensure that containers and host operating systems are hardened
- Ensure that environment and network segmentation is maintained

#### Scrum retrospective activities

- Reflect on operational concerns and incidents

#### Automated by CI/CD

- Ensure least privilege IAM
- Enable Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP)
- Patch known vulnerabilities automatically
- Secure audit logging

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 8 - Monitor

#### Product Owner

- Ensure integration of SIEM/SOAR and audit log monitoring
- Ensure anomaly detection and threat intelligence
- Use ML/behavioral analytics

#### Scrum retrospective activities

- Track and discuss vulnerability resolution metrics
- Review incident handling effectiveness

#### Automated by CI/CD

- Automate incident response with playbooks and ticketing
- Detect and alert on IDS/IPS events
- Run continuous monitoring pipelines

---

## Detect versus Protect

The number of cybersecurity tools and acronyms continues to grow steadily. For
SDLC controls it is important to understand the distinction between:

- detect, identifying and alerting on threats and suspicious activities and;
- protect, actively safeguard systems and data by preventing and blocking threats.

The table below explains the roles and capabilities of IDS/IPS and SIEM/SOAR controls:

| Control | Role                                                              | Detect | Protect |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :-----: |
| IDS     | Monitor network or system traffic to detect suspicious activities |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚ùå    |
| IPS     | Detect and actively block threats                                 |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ    |
| SIEM    | Collect, analyze and correlate security events                    |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚ùå    |
| SOAR    | Automate and orchestrate response actions                         |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ    |

## Risk analysis

Every software development project is unique, which means the cost benefit
analysis used to decide which security controls to implement must be tailored to
the specific context and risks of that project.
