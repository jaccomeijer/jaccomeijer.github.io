## Security controls for software development

The foundation for this post is in the post below.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'software-development-security')} swapImage={true} />

## DevSecOps

In strong contrast to Waterfall, DevSecOps is a modern approach that integrates
security throughout the entire SDLC.

Outlining security controls for software development by following the DevSecOps
approach works well because security is integrated into every step of
DevSecOps.

  caption="The DevSecOps approach with security integrated in every step"
/>

Figure 1 shows how the steps relate. Each step is outlined below and relates the
step to the relevant security controls, scrum roles, scrum events and which
controls could be added to automated CI/CD pipelines.

Controls from compliancy standards like ISO 27002 are not added but with the
help of AI, a simple basic set can be generated. For making the list more
actionable AI can also assist with tool recommendations.

Not all security controls are equally critical. Their implementation must always
be guided by risk assessments. In this post, controls are categorized and
prioritized based on relative importance, as outlined below.

| Importance | Description                                                                                     | Criteria                                                                                                 |

| Essential  | Foundational controls necessary for baseline security and operational integrity.                | Supports core security functions (e.g., detection, response); significantly reduces risk.                |
| Important  | Controls that enhance security posture and efficiency but are not critical to basic operations. | Improves detection, visibility or response; offers strong but deferrable security and process benefits.  |
| Optional   | Advanced or supplemental controls that add value in mature or resource-rich environments.       | Useful for optimization; may require more resources, customization or maturity to implement effectively. |

## Detect versus Protect

The number of cybersecurity tools and acronyms continues to grow steadily. For
SDLC controls it is important to understand the distinction between:

- detect, identifying and alerting on threats and suspicious activities and;
- protect, actively safeguard systems and data by preventing and blocking threats.

The table below explains the roles and capabilities of IDS/IPS and SIEM/SOAR controls:

| Control | Role                                                              | Detect | Protect |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :-----: |
| IDS     | Monitor network or system traffic to detect suspicious activities |   ✅   |   ❌    |
| IPS     | Detect and actively block threats                                 |   ✅   |   ✅    |
| SIEM    | Collect, analyze and correlate security events                    |   ✅   |   ❌    |
| SOAR    | Automate and orchestrate response actions                         |   ✅   |   ✅    |

## Risk analysis

This post outlines many security controls whose full implementation is only
justified in very high risk or mission critical software projects.

In practice, selecting which controls to implement is guided by a cost benefit
analysis. Evaluating the security improvements that each control offers to the
SDLC compared to the resources required to implement them.

These benefits are best understood through thorough risk analysis. This helps
identify which threats are most relevant and which controls provide the greatest
value in mitigating them.

More on risk analysis is in the post below.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'risk-analysis-software-development')} swapImage={true} />

## Conclusion

By embedding security into every phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC),
the DevSecOps approach ensures that security is no longer an afterthought, but a
continuous and integrated discipline. From planning and coding to deployment and
monitoring, each step introduces targeted controls that reduce risk and increase
resilience.

and security.

In an environment where threats evolve rapidly, DevSecOps provides a structured
yet flexible foundation for building secure software by design, by default and
by deployment.
