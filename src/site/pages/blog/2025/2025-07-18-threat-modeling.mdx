## Threat modeling roots

Threat modeling has it roots in organizations that needed to manage risk. At
first this was mainly military strategy and software engineering and over time
it formalized within the field of cyber security.

## Risk frameworks

Threat modeling is part of the broader scope 'managing risk'. Two of the most
trusted cyber security frameworks describe risk management as an essential part
of cyber security but these frameworks do not describe the 'how'. More on
those frameworks in the post below.

Threat modeling on the other hand is all about the 'how'. It is a set of
methods, techniques and tools that help managing risk in a practical way. The
practical nature of the field make that threat modeling often is referred to as
a culture.

Threat modeling is a natural fit for ISO 27001 and NIST CSF as it contributes to
managing risk.

## Threat modeling culture

Back in 2007 when devOps found its way into the world, the adoption of the idea
was often referred to as a culture shift. From separate silo's to an integrated
process.

For threat modeling the culture shift is from upfront security risk assessment
to the awareness that risk assessment is a continuous process that ideally lives
within the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Attack surface challenges

Frequent threats on a large attack surfaces make managing the imposed risks a
challenge. Challenging for small and medium businesses and an even more for
governments and larger enterprises.

The observatory nature of threat modeling helps with these challenges. Risk
assessment as a continuous process makes risk management much more efficient and
the collaborative nature of threat modeling improve the quality of the
assessments.

## Threat modeling methods

### MITRE ATT&CK

[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) is a globally-accessible knowledge base
of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

### STRIDE method

[STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model) was developed by Microsoft
in the 90s and is a useful classification system for grouping threats.

### PASTA method

PASTA is an abbreviation for Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis.

The method uses the attacker perspective as a starting point and combines
business goals with a technical scope. The structured method can be repeated
which makes it suitable for industries where compliance is key.

### Other methods

Use this AI-prompt to get started and customize where needed.

## Threat modeling techniques

Common techniques for threat modeling include the start perspective, using a
spreadsheet and using a whiteboard.

### Start perspective

Depending on the context threats are commonly defined by starting with one of
these three perspectives.

| Perspective | Starting point for identifying threats                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attacker    | Setup a motivation stack for possible attackers                         |
| Asset       | Classify assets by determining quantitative and qualitative asset value |
| Software    | Visualize components, processes and data flows                          |

### Spreadsheet technique

A classic approach to threat modeling is the spreadsheet exercise. Simply add
the components of risk, as mentioned at the start of this post, to the columns of
a spreadsheet and fill the rows with possible threats and risk treatments.

From spreadsheets it's a small step to a more structured approach using specific
tooling. From there integration with Enterprise Architecture as a next step is a
way to reach the holistic view on security risk.

### Whiteboard technique

More in depth is the whiteboard approach where developers, IT architects and
stakeholders together identify threats and compose possible treatments. Once a
threat is identified on the whiteboard, the threat can be formalized and
documented by adding the threat to Enterprise Architecture.

Specific tradeoffs of treatments are added and updated when situations change.

## Threat modeling tools

Many threat modeling tools exist. Below an example threat model distributed with
the free [OWASP](https://owasp.org) Threat Dragon tool.

Tooling can help, but a threat modeling culture should be the main goal.

## KPIs

Common practice for threat modeling is KPI monitoring. Because true value is in
the culture a good indicator is job satisfaction for roles involved in threat
modeling. Of course, many other obvious metrics can be monitored.

## Conclusion

Threat modeling is a good fit for both ISO 27001 and NIST CSF standards. It
provides the context based risk management described by both standards.

The standards describe that managing security risks is a collaborative effort
and how this should be a foundational element of an organization. This
collaborative effort is at the core of the threat modeling culture.

### Strengthen with Enterprise Architecture

Combining ISO 27001, NIST CSF and threat modeling with Enterprise Architecture
strengthens all elements. More on that in the post below.
