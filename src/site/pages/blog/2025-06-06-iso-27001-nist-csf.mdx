## ISO 27001 and NIST CSF 2.0

ISO 27001 and NIST CSF 2.0 are two of the most trusted security standards in the
world. Both with a different purpose, but their goals align and they complement
each other well.

This makes that using both strengthens your cybersecurity strategy. To
understand how they complement we need to take three other standards into
account that contain the related security controls:

- ISO 27001
- NIST SP 800-53
- NIST SP 800-53A

## Comparing the two with AI

A simple AI-prompt gives a quick overview of the five standards

```md
Create a matrix:
- conditions:
  - output on screen csv
  - use ‚úÖ for yes
  - use ‚ùå for no
  - use üü† for partial
  - add clarification to every icon, avoid comma‚Äôs
- horizontal:
  - ISO 27001
  - ISO 27002
  - NIST CSF 2.0
  - NIST SP 800-53
  - NIST SP 800-53a
- vertical:
  - is detailed control catalog
  - is security roadmap
  - is technical implementation guide
  - is assessment guide
  - defines mandatory controls
  - certification
```

## AI Response

The prompt gives a matrix with a lot of detail. Below is the simplified and
curated version of the AI response:

|  | ISO 27001 | ISO 27002 | NIST CSF 2.0 | NIST SP 800-53 | NIST SP 800-53a |
|--|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| is control catalog | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| is security roadmap | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| is technical guide | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| is assessment guide | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| defines mandatory federal controls | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| defines mandatory certification controls | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| certification | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |


From the matrix it is clear how the two standards complement. NIST CSF 2.0 is a
 roadmap on managing cyber risk and ISO 27001 complements by adding a structured
system and certification.

## Advantages

Using both gives the advantages that both standards offer. The standards have in
common that they are well known and recognized around the world. They also both
provides a clear common cyber security language across a large organization.

### ISO 27001 specific advantages

- ISO 27001 is part of an Integrated Management System that integrates with many
other useful standards like ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001
- Structured system for controlling and proving
- Systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and treating information
  security risks
- Certification
- Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, promoting improvement

### NIST CSF 2.0 specific advantages

- NIST CSF 2.0 maps to many other standards, see [NIST
  Crosswalks](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/resource-repository/browse/crosswalks)
- Provides a practical roadmap
- Designed to be flexible
- Outcome-Focused
- Provides a full set of cyber security capabilities and business functions

## Architecture

One of the advantages of NIST CSF 2.0 is that it defines a full set of cyber
security capabilities and business functions. This set easily translates to the
Archimate modeling language.

The capabilities and business functions are shown in the model below. From the
capabilities a simple matrix can be setup that links the capabilities to the
control measures defined by ISO 27002. By example the model below visualizes
four of them.

## Archimate security elements

The Control Measure element used for the ISO 27001 control is explained in the
post blow.
