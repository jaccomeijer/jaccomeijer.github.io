## ISO 27001 and NIST CSF 2.0

ISO 27001 and NIST CSF 2.0 are two of the most trusted security standards in the
world. Both with a different purpose, but their goals align and they complement
each other well.

This makes that using both strengthens your cybersecurity strategy. To
understand how they complement we need to take three other standards into
account that contain the related security controls:

- ISO 27001
- NIST SP 800-53
- NIST SP 800-53A

## Comparing the two with AI

A simple AI-prompt gives a quick overview of the five standards

```md
Create a matrix:
- conditions:
  - output on screen csv
  - use ‚úÖ for yes
  - use ‚ùå for no
  - use üü† for partial
  - add clarification to every icon, avoid comma‚Äôs
- horizontal:
  - ISO 27001
  - ISO 27002
  - NIST CSF 2.0
  - NIST SP 800-53
  - NIST SP 800-53a
- vertical:
  - is detailed control catalog
  - is security roadmap
  - is technical implementation guide
  - is assessment guide
  - defines mandatory controls
  - certification
```

## AI Response

The prompt gives a matrix with a lot of detail. Below is the simplified and
curated version of the AI response:

|  | ISO 27001 | ISO 27002 | NIST CSF 2.0 | NIST SP 800-53 | NIST SP 800-53a |
|--|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| is control catalog | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| is security roadmap | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| is technical guide | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| is assessment guide | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| defines mandatory federal controls | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| defines mandatory certification controls | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| certification | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |


From the matrix it is clear how the two standards complement. NIST CSF 2.0 is a
 roadmap on managing cyber risk and ISO 27001 complements by adding a structured
system and certification.

## Advantages

Using both gives the advantages that both standards offer. The standards have in
common that they are well known and recognized around the world. They also both
provide a clear common cyber security language especially useful for larger
organizations.

These are some of the major advantages for each of them.

### ISO 27001 specific advantages

- Part of an Integrated Management System that integrates with many other useful
standards like ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001
- Structured system for controlling risks and proving control
- Systematic way of identifying, assessing, and treating information security
  risks
- Certification possible
- Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, promoting improvement

### NIST CSF 2.0 specific advantages

- NIST CSF 2.0 maps to many other standards, see [NIST
  Crosswalks](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/resource-repository/browse/crosswalks)
- Provides a practical roadmap
- Designed to be flexible
- Outcome focused
- Provides a full set of cyber security capabilities and business functions

## Enterprise Architecture

One of the advantages of NIST CSF 2.0 is that the roadmap defines a full set of
cyber security capabilities and business functions. This set easily translates
to the Archimate modeling language.

This is useful set of business functions that is useful in many cyber security
architecture views. The advantage of the standard being well known contributes
to business functions that leave little room for misinterpretation.

The NIST CSF 2.0 capabilities and business functions are shown in the model
below. From the capabilities a simple matrix can be setup that links the
capabilities to the control measures defined by ISO 27002. By example the model
below visualizes four of them.

### Complement in detail

Besides the theory on how the two standards complement earlier in this post, the
matrix that links the two standards shows in detail how the standards complement
and how they strengthen each other.

Setting up the matrix is a useful exercise that gives insights in the way the
two standards were designed individually, how they differ and how they team up.

### Formal matrix

If you don't like the matrix exercise or need someone to oversee your matrix,
ISO 27002 contains a formal version of the matrix. ISO 27002 Annex A defines
five example attributes of which one is 'Cybersecurity concepts'.

These concepts are defined as `#Identify`, `#Protect`, `#Detect`, `#Respond` and
`#Recover` which correspond exactly to the five capabilities defined by NIST CSF
2.0. Unfortunately the Govern capability is missing, probably due to the fact
that this was added to NIST CSF with the release of version 2.0.

## Conclusion

ISO 27002 Annex A providing a formal matrix that links NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO
27001 together make that the two standards reliably can be used together with
little effort. This provides certification, a roadmap, common security language
and a well known set of business functions to be used in Enterprise
Architecture.

## Archimate security elements

For reference, the 'Control Measure' element used for the ISO 27001 control is
explained in the post blow.
