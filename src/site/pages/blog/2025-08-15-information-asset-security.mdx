## Definitions

Assets, data, categorization and classification are closely related. This post
starts with the definitions and relations.

Assets in this post are information assets. This is any information source that
has value and these can be tangible, intangible and logical.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|--|--|--|
| Tangible         | Physical assets that can be seen and measured                | hardware, network infrastructure |
| Intangible       | Non-physical assets that represent value                     | software, databases, information stores |
| Hybrid / Logical | Information assets that are logical or part tangible and part intangible | networks, information systems |

- An **asset** is a system that handles **data**
- **Classification** is assigning value and sensitivity based on content and context
- **Categorization** is grouping classified assets or data
- **Quantitative value** is the estimation of the numerical asset value
- **Qualitative value** is the assessment of an assets importance or impact

## Identification

Assets and data are added and removed from organizations frequently. These
changes have a significant impact organization security.

It is therefore important to identify assets and data. Also because the more you
know about your assets and data, the better you can protect them.

### Data identification

Because data governance is important for data identification all data should
have an owner. The diagram below shows the relationship between data roles and
the relevant requirements.

> Note that this post uses the word asset for information systems. The diagram
  below uses the word asset to describe data as an asset which differentiates
  from the actual data itself.

### Asset identification

Managing all information assets is essential for managing the security of these
assets. Because of the importance and the complexity of this task, organizations
use a variety of tools.

All kinds of scanners, directories, license trackers, automatic discovery
services, etc. All contribute to asset identification. AI helps by handling
large amounts of data and analysis.

### Asset management

Because of the many tools working together, all information should be
consolidated into one source of truth managed by a single authority. Which leads
to what is known as asset management.

Asset management is too broad to fit in the scope of this post, as is also true
for change management and configuration management.

## Classification

Classifying is important because treating security risks for all data and assets
equally is a costly approach. It is much more cost efficient to classify
sensitive and public data abd assets and differentiate accordingly.

### Data classification

Data classification is always best practice but is generally only formalized in
strongly regulated environments like military, governments and banks.

For other organizations data classification becomes increasingly mandatory with
every newly introduced cyber security law.

### Data classification types

Data classification can be divided into three primary types.

|  Classification Type  |  Description  |  Examples  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Content-Based**     | Analyzes the actual data within the file or message.         | Detects credit card numbers, PII, or sensitive keywords in documents. |
| **Context-Based**     | Uses metadata or environmental factors around the data.      | Classifies based on file location, sender/receiver, or access patterns. |
| **User-Based**        | Relies on user roles, behavior, or manual input.             | User selects classification label; defaults based on department or role. |

### Asset classification

Assets are the systems that handle the data and are often classified by predefined classification levels.

### Asset Classification Levels

AI is very suitable for scaffolding text. This is an example AI prompt on
setting up asset classification levels.

```md
create an Asset classification levels table:
- rules:
  - use tiers where tier 0 is the most restricted
  - include mixed tier
  - include example systems and devices
  - include desciption
  - include requirements
  - output visual markdown table
```

#### Generated asset classification levels table

| Tier | Description | Example Systems/Devices | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | Most restricted. Critical assets with highest confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs. | Core banking systems, encryption key vaults, national ID databases | Multi-factor authentication, Strict access control, Real-time monitoring, Encrypted storage |
| Tier 1 | Highly sensitive. Important for business continuity and compliance. | HR systems, financial reporting tools, internal legal databases | Role-based access, Regular audits, Secure backups, Patch management |
| Tier 2 | Moderately sensitive. Operational systems with limited exposure risk. | CRM platforms, internal collaboration tools, inventory systems | Standard authentication, Periodic vulnerability scans, User training |
| Tier 3 | Low sensitivity. Public-facing or non-critical systems. | Company website, marketing tools, public documentation portals | Basic security hygiene, Monitoring for anomalies, Regular updates |
| Mixed Tier | Assets spanning multiple tiers due to integrated functions or shared infrastructure. | Hybrid cloud environments, shared databases, mobile device fleets | Segmentation controls, Tier-specific policies per component, Continuous risk assessment |


### How organizations classify assets

Key regulations and frameworks define how organizations must classify and
categorize information assets, often shaping their asset identification and
protection policies.

Below an example AI prompt that generates an overview of common regulations on
asset classification for jurisdictions EU, USA and China.

```md
create a matrix:
- rows:
  - GPDR (EU)
  - NIS 2 (EU)
  - NIST SP 800-60 (USA)
  - FIPS 199 (USA)
  - FISMA (USA)
  - MLPS (China)
  - PIPL (China)
- columns:
  - classify
  - category
- cells: summarized search results in text 
- rules:
  - generate 5 variants for each term and log them
  - also search for variants
  - limit search to official regulation text
  - output markdown table that can be copied
```

#### Generated regulation sources table

| Regulation           | Source URL                                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| GDPR (EU)            | https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng            |
| NIS 2 Directive (EU) | https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj/eng           |
| NIST SP 800-60 (USA) | https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/60/v2/r1/final             |
| FIPS 199 (USA)       | https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/199/final                    |
| FISMA (USA)          | https://csrc.nist.gov/topics/laws-and-regulations/laws/fisma |
| MLPS 2.0 (China)     | https://openstd.samr.gov.cn/bzgk/gb/newGbInfo?hcno=BAFB47E8874764186BDB7865E8344DAF |
| PIPL (China)         | https://en.spp.gov.cn/2021-12/29/c_948419.htm                |


#### Generated asset classification regulations matrix

|  Framework                 |  **Classify**                                                                              |  **Category**                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **GDPR (EU)**             |  Used in guidance for security levels (e.g., EU RESTRICTED), not in the core regulation.  |  Defines “special categories” of sensitive personal data (e.g., health, race).                 |
|  **NIS 2 (EU)**            |  Refers to classifying entities by criticality (essential vs. important).                 |  Entities are grouped into categories that determine obligations and oversight.                |
|  **NIST SP 800-60 (USA)**  |  Implies classification through mapping data to impact levels.                         |  Central concept: categorizing data by confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.   |
|  **FIPS 199 (USA)**        |  Classification not used; focuses on categorizing systems by impact on security objectives.  |  Defines categories based on impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.   |
|  **FISMA (USA)**           |  Requires categorization of systems; relies on NIST guidance, not classification terminology.  |  Uses security categories to guide risk management and control selection.                      |
|  **MLPS (CHINA)**          |  Uses formal classification levels (1–5) based on system sensitivity and national interest.  |  Categorizes systems by role and criticality to determine protection requirements.             |
|  **PIPL (CHINA)**          |  Implies classification via “sensitive personal information” requiring stricter handling.  |  Defines categories of personal data, especially sensitive types like biometrics and health data.  |
