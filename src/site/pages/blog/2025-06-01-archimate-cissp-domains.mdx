## Security architect

Security is a broad area. The CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) divides the
profession into eight domains.

1) Security and risk management
2) Asset security
3) Security architecture and engineering
4) Communication and network security
5) Identity and access management
6) Security assessment and testing
7) Security operations

Actual security architecture is covered by domain 3.
