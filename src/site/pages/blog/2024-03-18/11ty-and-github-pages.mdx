## A bit of history

Around 2018 the first projects emerged using
[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). This is still is a great setup for
generating static sites.

  })}

The main drawback? It 's a heavy solution for a simple static site. Mainly
because it requires three independent services.

## A simpler solution

Besides the GatsbyJs framework, the Contentful setup requires three services to
work together:

- Contentful
- Netlify
- Github

<Picture className="s-block-space u-block-space-s" src="/site/pages/blog/2024-03-18/Contentful-Gatsby-Netlify.png" />

Six years later, Netlify grew to be a popular platform for hosting static sites.
Github pages also grew in popularity. For this specific setup, switching from
Netlify to Github pages eliminates one of the three services.

## 11ty

If Contentful could be simplified the same way, Github would be the only service
required.

Saving the content to Github as Markdown is a simple way to achieve this but
brings up a new question. How to work with reusable pieces of content?

Having a closer look at Github pages learns that Github pages is driven by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and Jekyll uses the [Liquid template
language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) created by Shopify for templates.

From Jekyll it is a small step to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) because 11ty is
the JavaScript alternative to the Ruby based Jekyll.

Replacing Gatsby with 11ty and storing the site content in Markdown allows for
removing Contentful from the list of required services.

## Migrating existing content

With the new setup, 11ty generates the site HTML which is then pushed to Github.
This successfully replaces the Gatsby generated site.

All good! Until existing content is migrated. This brings up two areas of
interest:

1. page metadata and
2. reusable components.

### 1. Page metadata

Handling page metadata is a common requirement for Static Site Generators. The
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) generator handles this by adding metadata to the top
of a Markdown page. The metadata is then called 'Front Matter'.

A quick example of Front Matter:

```yaml
---
date: 2024-01-01T02:16:22-09:00
draft: false
title: Front Matter title
---
```

11ty uses Front Matter by default and NPM packages exist that handle the
extraction from documents.

### 2. Reusable components

Components in a template world are commonly referred to as 'includes'.
Including another piece of Markdown works as a simple component solution.

Markdown renders to HTML and Markdown allows for including HTML. This makes that
complex component requirements can be handled with a HTML based solution. Some
popular ones are:

- [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc), 11ty's answer to Web Components.
- [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com), a popular library for building Web
  Components.
- Native HTML Custom Elements and the new `declarative shadow dom`, finally
  gained Mozilla support in February 2024.
- `JSX`, the popular Javascript extension by Facebook/React.

WebC is an excellent solution for reusable components. Especially when using
11ty. But, being familiar with Gatsby and React, how about using JSX functions
for components?

> issues of styling these components.

## MDX

Combining 11ty, Markdown and WebC is a common approach.

Using 11ty, Markdown and JSX together is not. This is because combining
Markdown and JSX is so obvious that it has its own name. It's called MDX and
[mdxjs.com](https://mdxjs.com) clearly explains how this works.

While not the most common solution, using JSX as a template language in 11ty is
very well possible. Paul Everitt, the PyCharm/WebStorm Developer Advocate at
JetBrains, created a JSX setup with Typescript:

## Conclusion

The Contentful-Gatsby-Netlify trio can be simplified by using 11ty and Github
pages. Any component solution can be used. For 11ty, WebC components is a solid
choice.

## Static site generator for MDX

Diving a bit deeper into MDX, it seems that using
[@mdx-js/esbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/esbuild) with some
custom logic could make Esbuild into a simple but powerful static site
generator.

The quest for simplicity continues in the next post!
