## Combining ISO 27001 and NIST CSF

The post below on NIST CSF and ISO 27001 states that the standards have
different purposes, but their goals align and the standards strengthen each
other.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'iso-27001-nist-csf')} swapImage={true} />

The two are relatively easy to compare and both can be used independent of
jurisdiction and country. For many specific countries however, alignment with
local regulations is required. This adds extra complexity to the identification
of compliancy gaps. When the scope is extended from IT to OT this complexity is
extended even further.

> When this post mentions standards, this includes frameworks and regulations.

The table below shows a practical example of the standards that commonly need
alignment in the Netherlands. The 62443 family of standards is included as an
example for Operational Technology (OT).


| Standard | Description |
|--|--|
| ISO 27001 Standard        | Risk based Management System standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving Information Security.|
| ISO 27002 Standard        | Supporting standard on control implementation.|
| ISA/IEC 62443 Standards   | A series of standards for industrial automation and control systems (IACS) cybersecurity.|
| NIST SP 800-53 Standard   | US federal standard providing a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls.|
| NIST CSF 2.0 Framework    | Voluntary risk based outcome focused framework designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.|
| NIS2 Directive            | Binding EU regulation that mandates cybersecurity requirements for essential and important entities.|
| GDPR Regulation           | EU regulation on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and EEA.|
| BIO2 Framework/Regulation | Mandatory baseline framework aligning with ISO 27001/27002.|

## Challenges

### Compliancy gaps

One of the major challenges is identifying compliancy gaps and assuring all
legal obligations are met. Article 20 of the NIS2 Directive for example,
mandates that management bodies (e.g. board members, executives) must approve
and oversee the implementation of cybersecurity risk management measures.

Consider a company that is ISO 27001 certified. This company uses the
Information Security Management System (ISMS) in line with the objective of the
standard. Many of the standards that need alignment have similar objectives that
intersect or are subsets of the ISMS defined objectives.

Besides the possible redundant work caused by overlapping standards, the overlap
introduces the risk of compliancy gaps and possible contradicting requirements.

### Mapping standards

Overlapping standards and compliancy gaps cause major challenges. One of the
best solutions to manage these overlapping standards are consistent and reliable
mappings between the standards. These mappings are often referred to as
crosswalks.

The USA based NIST organization for example, [publishes many
crosswalks](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/resource-repository/browse/crosswalks)
from and to their standards.

The table below shows some of the most common crosswalks that are available for
the standards in this post.

| From | To | Crosswalk source |
|--|--|--|
| ISO 27001:2022     | ISA 62443-2-1:2024  | 62443-2-1 Annex A.4, Table A.7 |

### Crosswalk spreadsheet pitfalls

For many companies it is common practice to have a spreadsheet with crosswalks
between the relevant standards. As the list of standards to comply with grows,
so does the spreadsheet and a growing spreadsheet can easily lead to one of the
following pitfalls:

- mixing control objectives and control measures;
- lack of canonical id's;
- poor version management;
- ignoring shared responsibility in cloud contexts;
- neglecting bidirectional mappings.

### Crosswalk reliability

The common pitfalls show the importance of reliable crosswalks. A good solution
that ensures reliable crosswalks is the [NIST IR
8477](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8477/final) standard. The standard is named
"Developing Cybersecurity and Privacy Concept Mappings" and helps with
understanding how one standard supports another and how to identify compliance
gaps.

The standards achieves this by setting up an approach that is named 'Set Theory
Relationship Mapping (STRM)'.

### Set Theory Relationship Mapping

> Definition: STRM is a relationship style derived from the branch of
mathematics known as set theory. Each mapping done with this style includes both
a rationale for the mapping and a relationship type.

STRM supports three options for the rationale and five relationship types for
documenting the logical similarity of two concepts.

#### Rationale
1. Syntactic: How similar is the wording?
2. Semantic: How similar are the meanings of the two concepts?
3. Functional: How similar are the results of executing the two concepts?

#### Relationship types
1. Subset of
2. Intersects with
3. Equal
4. Superset of
5. No relationship

### Relating the standards to risk

With the STRM approach consistent and reliable mappings can be setup between the
standards. This ensures that compliancy gaps are identified and that all legal
obligations are met.

From here, the next challenge is to relate the objectives from all standards to
the three elements of risk: threats, vulnerabilities and assets.

Below is a diagram from an <a href={blogOpenerByNavId(props,
'threat-modeling-enterprise-architecture-context').action.url}>earlier post on
Enterprise Architecture</a> where the elements of risk are modeled in red and
the control measure (Data in transit is secure) and objective (Protection of
sensitive data) are modeled in green.

<Diagram src="/site/pages/blog/images-security-framework/ersm-base.svg" width="45rem" />

Multiple standards generally contain multiple sets of control measures and
objectives. The standards in this post for example have measures defined by ISO
27002, NIST SP 800-53r5 and ISA/IEC 62443 and all standards define control
objectives.

To be able to relate the elements of risk in a clean and a consistent manner, a
consistent set of objectives that acts as a single source of truth is required.
For ISO 27001 certified organizations an obvious choice is to use the ISMS
objectives as a canonical set.

Using the control objectives from ISO 27002 as a canonical set adds more
granularity to the set which makes it a better fit than the objectives of the
ISMS itself. The best set covers all objectives of the ISMS and has a decent
amount of granularity. ISO 27002 is often a good fit, as can be e.g. NIST SP
800-53.

## Canonical control objectives

The diagram below shows how the chosen set of canonical control objectives is
mapped to the objectives of multiple standards.

The canonical control objective element has a structural aggregation
relationship with the control objectives of standard x. To ensure consistency
and to identify possible compliancy gaps, all related control objectives are
documented by STRM as outlined in NIST IR 8477.

<Diagram src="/site/pages/blog/images-security-framework/ersm-canonical.svg" width="45rem" />

## Secure Controls Framework (SCF)

Choosing a canonical set that fits is a common challenge for many companies.
This challenge resulted in an open source project called [Secure Controls
Framework](https://securecontrolsframework.com).

The framework defines a canonical set of controls and maps the set to all major
standards worldwide. The advantages are obvious. Having all the mappings readily
available saves a lot of work.

The framework is a good example of how the security community worldwide works
together. SCF is driven by a community of experts and published as an open
source project.

SCF is available as a spreadsheet and all STRM mappings are available in PDF
format. A small fee is required for the STRM mappings in spreadsheet format
which is a minor investment considering the gain.

SCF contains a threat catalog, a risk catalog, a set of domain principles, a set
of privacy principles and the canonical set of controls.

The last diagram in this post shows how the SCF defined elements relate. The
STRM mappings being modeled as an aggregation relationship.

## Other resources

The SCF solution is mentioned as an example GRC solution (Governance, Risk and
Compliance). Many other solutions exist. Leading solutions like ServiceNow,
Archer and MetricStream use proprietary schemas but align conceptually with
`OSCAL` or `SCF` for interoperability.

Language, a NIST initiative to modernize and automate the processes of security
and compliance.

### Prompt for Cyber security data schemas

```md
List available data schemas that capture details from security frameworks
- framework examples:
  - iso27001
  - nist csf
- details to capture:
  - requirements
  - controls
  - assessments
  - mappings
- output a summary table with:
  - Purpose
  - Key Components
  - Format
  - Use Case
  - Open or Proprietary
```

## Conclusion

A single canonical set of security controls can serve as a reliable source of
truth amidst the growing complexity of cybersecurity standards and regulations.

Rather than treating standards as separate or competing frameworks, integrating
them into one coherent control set simplifies compliancy, reduces duplication
and improves manageability.

Anchoring a security program into a single, well-structured set of controls
ensures consistent implementation, efficient audits and alignment with both
international best practices and national regulations.
