## Combining ISO 27001 and NIST CSF

The post below on NIST CSF and ISO 27001 states that the standards have
different purposes, but their goals align and the standards strengthen each
other.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'iso-27001-nist-csf')} swapImage={true} />

The two are relatively easy to compare and can both be used independent of
jurisdiction and country. For a specific country a standard must commonly align
with local regulations. When the scope is extended from IT to OT, the list of
standards becomes even longer.

> When this post mentions standards, this includes frameworks and regulations.

This post uses the Netherlands as an example and includes IT as well as OT.
Below a list of standards that are commonly used together in the Netherlands.

| Standard | Description |
|--|--|
| ISO 27001 Standard        | Risk based Management System standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving Information Security.|
| ISO 27002 Standard        | Supporting standard on control implementation.|
| ISA/IEC 62443 Standards   | A series of standards for industrial automation and control systems (IACS) cybersecurity.|
| NIST SP 800-53 Standard   | US federal standard providing a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls.|
| NIST CSF 2.0 Framework    | Voluntary risk based outcome focused framework designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.|
| NIS2 Directive            | Binding EU regulation that mandates cybersecurity requirements for essential and important entities.|
| GDPR Regulation           | EU regulation on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and EEA.|
| BIO2 Framework/Regulation | Mandatory baseline framework aligning with ISO 27001/27002.|

## Challenges

### Legal obligations

One of the major challenges is to assure that all legal obligations are met.
Article 20 of NIS2 mandates that management bodies (e.g. board members,
executives) must approve and oversee the implementation of cybersecurity risk
management measures.

Companies that are ISO 27001 certified have an Information Security Management
System (ISMS) in place. Many of the other standards have similar, but not equal,
requirements.

How to make sure that all legal obligations are met without doing things twice?
Setting up an ISMS alone is usually challenging enough. Repeating the setup
process for all standards individually is a lot of work and contains a lot of
redundant tasks.

### Mapping standards

The redundancy between standards make that many standards can be mapped to other
standards. This prevents double work, fully in line with the Don't Repeat
Yourself (DRY) principle.

The mapping of two or more standards in the cyber security field is often called
a 'crosswalk'. The USA based NIST organization [published many
crosswalks](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/resource-repository/browse/crosswalks)
from and to their own standards.

The table below shows some of the most common crosswalks available for the
standards in this post.

| From | To | Crosswalk source |
|--|--|--|
| ISO 27001:2022     | ISA 62443-2-1:2024  | 62443-2-1 Annex A.4, Table A.7 |
| ISO 27002:2013     | ISO 27002:2022      | ISO 27002 ANNEX B |
| ISO 27002:2022     | NIST CSF v1         | ISO 27002 ANNEX A - TAGS |
| NIST CSF v2.0      | NIST SP 800-53r5    | NIST CSF-pf-to-sp800-53r5-mappings.xlsx |
| NIST CSF v2.0      | ISA 62443-2-1:2024  | 62443-2-1 Annex A.4, Table A.9 |

| ISA 62443-2-1:2024 | NIST CSF v1         | 62443-2-1 Annex A.4, Table A.10 |
| NIS2               | ISO 27001:2022      | ENISA Technical Implementation Guidance Mapping table version 1.1 |

### Crosswalk assessments

A consistent assessment of how two standards map increases the reliability of a
mapping. This is a useful practice in the field of cyber security and this why
the NIST organization developed a standard for mapping standards called
"Developing Cybersecurity and Privacy Concept Mappings", published as [NIST IR
8477](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8477/final)

The standard helps with understanding how one standard supports another and how
to identify compliance gaps. To achieve this the approach in the standard uses
the Set Theory Relationship Mapping (STRM).

### Set Theory Relationship Mapping

> Definition: STRM is a relationship style derived from the branch of
mathematics known as set theory. Each mapping done with this style includes both
a rationale for the mapping and a relationship type.

STRM supports three options for the rationale and five relationship types for
documenting the logical similarity of two concepts.

#### Rationale
1. Syntactic: How similar is the wording?
2. Semantic: How similar are the meanings of the two concepts?
3. Functional: How similar are the results of executing the two concepts?

#### Relationship types
1. Subset of
2. Intersects with
3. Equal
4. Superset of
5. No relationship

### Relating standards to risk

Once all standards are consistently mapped and the standards cover all legal
obligations, a final challenge is relating all standards to the three components
of risk: threats, vulnerabilities and assets.

Below is a diagram from an <a href={blogOpenerByNavId(props,
'threat-modeling-enterprise-architecture-context').action.url}>earlier post on
Enterprise Architecture</a> where the components of risk are modeled in red and
the control measure "Data in transit is secure" and control objective
"Protection of sensitive data" are modeled in green.

<Diagram src="/site/pages/blog/images-security-framework/ersm-base.svg" width="45rem" />

This diagram is used in the next paragraph to setup a single set of normalized
control measures by replacing the control measure "Data in transit is secure" by
a normalized set.

## Normalized control measures

Multiple standards usually contain multiple sets of control measures and
multiple sets of control objectives. The standards in this post for example have
measures defined by ISO 27002, NIST SP 800-53r5 and ISA/IEC 62443 and almost all
of the standards define control objectives.

The diagram below shows how a normalized set of control measures can be mapped
to the measures and objectives of many different standards.

Once all of the normalized controls are mapped to the individual standards by
using STRM, all standards consistently work together eliminating unknown
compliancy gaps.

<Diagram src="/site/pages/blog/images-security-framework/ersm-normalized-controls.svg" width="45rem" />

## Secure Controls Framework (SCF)

The [Secure Controls Framework](https://securecontrolsframework.com) is a good
example of a framework that uses this normalized control measure approach. As
a framework of frameworks it can be referred to as a meta framework.

SCF is driven by a community of experts, open source and contains STRM mappings
from a normalized set of control measures to all major standards worldwide.
Using the normalized set with reliable STRM mappings in place saves a lot of
work, a major benefit of using SCF.

SCF is available as an Excel sheet and all STRM mappings are available in PDF
format. A small fee is required for the STRM mappings in Excel format which is
a minor investment considering the gain.

A final diagram shows how the SCF defined elements relate. SCF contains a basic
set of threats and vulnerabilities, as well as a set of domain principles, a set
of privacy principles and the normalized set of control measures.

The STRM mappings are modeled as relationships － with example relationship
types － to the External Control Measure and the External Control Objective
elements.

## Other resources

Wondering what other frameworks exist that do similar things? Use the prompt
below as a starter. This specific field is often referred to as Governance, Risk
and Compliance (GRC).

Many enterprise GRC solutions like ServiceNow, Archer and MetricStream use
proprietary schemas but align conceptually with `OSCAL` or `SCF` for
interoperability.

> [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/): Open Security Controls Assessment
Language, a NIST initiative to modernize and automate the processes of security
and compliance.
