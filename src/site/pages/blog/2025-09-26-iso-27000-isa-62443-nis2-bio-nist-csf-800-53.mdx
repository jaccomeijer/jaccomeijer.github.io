## NIST CSF Categories

The post below on NIST CSF and ISO 27001 states that the standards have
different purposes, but their goals align and the standards strengthen each
other.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'iso-27001-nist-csf')} swapImage={true} />

The two are relatively easy to compare and can both be used independent of
jurisdiction and country. For a specific country a standard must commonly align
with local regulations. When the scope is extended from IT to OT, the list of
standards becomes even longer.

> When this post mentions standards, this includes frameworks and regulations as
well.

This post uses the Netherlands as an example and includes IT as well as OT.
Below is a combination of standards that are commonly used in the Netherlands.

- ISO 27001 and 27002 (standards)
- NIST CSF (framework)
- NIST SP 800-53 (standard)
- ISA/IEC 62443 (standard)
- NIS2 Directive (regulation)
- BIO (Government Information Security Baseline)

## Overview of the standards

Before exploring the challenges that the combination brings, this is a brief
overview of the individual standards.

### ISO 27001 and 27002 Standards

Risk based standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually
improving an Information Security Management System.

ISO 27002 is the supporting standard on control implementation.

### NIST CSF 2.0 Framework

Voluntary risk based outcome focused framework designed to help organizations
manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.

### NIST SP 800-53 Standard

US federal standard providing a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy
controls.

### ISA/IEC 62443 Standards

A series of standards for industrial automation and control systems (IACS)
cybersecurity.

### NIS2 Directive

Binding EU regulation that mandates cybersecurity requirements for essential and
important entities. Legally enforceable and must be implemented by member
states.

### BIO Framework and regulation  

Mandatory baseline framework aligning with ISO 27001/27002. BIO2 will become a
legal requirement, making it both a framework and regulation.

## Challenges

- How to align all? -> Focus on controls
- Crosswalk sources?
- How to document this alignment? -> NIST IR 8477
- Prevent double work during Audits?
- Link to individual projects?
- Link to TOGAF ABB and SBB?
- Overlapping Requirements
- Conflicting Requirements
- Scope Differences
