## UI library case study

For a small React project a UI library is created. The library is maintained in
a NPM module with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Each time the
library changes the module is updated.

Over time the library grows to 30 components and is used in 5 projects. When a
project requires a change the library is updated and the project is updated to
use the latest version.

For the case described here this works well except for one project. This project
uses the oldest version of the library and is never updated because of the many
changes between the oldest version and the latest version of the library.

To overcome this deadlock situation the single library module is split into 30
component modules. The project with the oldest version of the library can now
update the version of a single component.

## Large modules

### UI library

A lesson from the UI library case is that large modules have the risk of
creating deadlock situations. This is especially true for actively developed
modules because upgrading from the oldest to the latest version has a lot of
impact.

### Project module

The project module is the module on the highest level. This module is often
overlooked when splitting into submodules.

The risk of a large project module is that updating a dependency potentially has
great impact. The larger the project and the more the dependency is used, the
harder it is to oversee the impact.

## Component versions

### Latest version

The UI library case shows that splitting up into component modules is a solution
for the deadlock situation.

The major drawback of individually versioned components is that a component with
version 1.8.4 looks older than a component with version 3.0.0 while in reality
this may be the other way around.

### Library version

The solution to the individual component versions is to maintain a single
library version for all components. When a component updates, the library
version is used to calculate the new version. Both the component and the library
are set to the new version.

### Monorepo

A [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) can do exactly that. Tools
like [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna) can be configured to version the packages
as required.
