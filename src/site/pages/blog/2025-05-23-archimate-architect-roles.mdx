## Who uses ArchiMate?

In the post below about the ArchiMate language the question 'who uses this
language?' comes up. The short answer here is IT architects. The long answer is
in this post.

## IT architects

This list of IT architect roles is long. This post started with the Chief,
Enterprise and Solutions roles in mind but the list is longer. Time for a quick
ArchiMate model.

## The model

From an ArchiMate perspective, the roles could be simple. A strategy architect, a
business architect, an application architect and a technology architect. The
strategy architect overseeing the full architecture.

In real life, IT architect roles do not follow this ArchiMate abstraction. Many
roles exist and depending on the context the expected activities vary.

This post uses the example roles from the TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills
Guide (10th edition). The guide uses the three TOGAF viewpoints for managing an
enterprise architecture landscape to describe architect roles. The viewpoints
are:

- A complete **enterprise** and its overall structure
- Specific **segments** (relevant elements) of the enterprise that have
  coherence and can be governed and evolved effectively
- Specific **solutions** that utilize the components within the segments to
  remove, change, or introduce new solutions and their associated sub-systems,
  systems, and services

The model below relates these viewpoints to the the four TOGAF defined architect
roles: chief, enterprise, segment and solutions architect.

## Specialists

Besides the four TOGAF defined architect roles, the segments viewpoint shows
three groups of specialists. Business specialists on the left, technology
specialists on the right. A similar division is found in the TOGAF architecture
Roles and Skills Guide.

The two groups on the right mimic the ArchiMate layers on the bottom. Likewise
the group on the left could be divided if needed.

## TOGAF defined roles

The TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills Guide contains detailed descriptions of
these roles.

All architects focus on delivering services and solutions. Below how the role
varies in the level of abstraction and specificity.

### Chief architect

Chief architects communicate concepts and ideas to all executives and are
responsible for gaining their commitment. They lead all architects on the
highest level and provide strategic alignment.

### Enterprise architect

Enterprise architects work with senior stakeholders, they define architectural
principles and oversee governance.

### Segment architect

Larger enterprises have segment architects that handle segments of the
enterprise architecture.

They are responsible for the capabilities of a segment and collaborate with
solution architects and specialists.

### Solution architect

Solution architects collaborate with business and specialist stakeholders. They
make sure solutions meet specific requirements and ensure desired business
outcomes. Part of that responsibility is that they oversee architectural and
solution building blocks.

## Security architect

The model defines a security architect for all three specialist groups. This is
because security is a broad area. As can be learned from the CISSP Common Body
of Knowledge which divides the profession into eight domains:

1) Security and risk management
2) Asset security
3) Security architecture and engineering
4) Communication and network security
5) Identity and access management
6) Security assessment and testing
7) Security operations

Actual security architecture is covered by domain 3. But all domains can be
mapped to specific ArchiMate layers. More on this in the post below.

## Specialists

For all of the specialist roles in the model this is a brief summary of the
modeling activities for each and what this should align this with.

###  Business specialists

- Models business strategy and process.
- Align with technology strategy and process.
