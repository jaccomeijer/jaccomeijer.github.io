## Who uses ArchiMate?

The post below talkes about who uses ArchiMate. The short answer here is IT
architects. The long answer is in this post.

## IT Architects

This list of IT architect roles is long. This post started with the Chief,
Enterprise and Solutions roles in mind but the list is a lot longer. That
required a quick model.

## The model

From an ArchiMate perspective, the roles could be simple. A strategy architect, a
business architect, an application architect and a technology architect. The
strategy architect overseeing the full architecture.

In real life, IT architect roles do not follow this ArchiMate abstraction. This
post uses the Example roles from the TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills Guide.

The TOGAF standard provides three viewpoints to manage an enterprise
architecture landscape:

- A complete **enterprise** and its overall structure
- Specific **segments** (relevant elements) of the enterprise that have
  coherence and can be governed and evolved effectively
- Specific **solutions** that utilize the components within the segments to
  remove, change, or introduce new solutions and their associated sub-systems,
  systems, and services

The model below uses these viewpoints and shows the relationships of the four
TOGAF defined Architect roles:

- Chief Architect
- Enterprise Architect
- Segment Architect
- Solutions Architect

## The roles

Besides the four TOGAF defined Architect roles, the segments viewpoint contains
many other architect roles. From TOGAF perspective these are specialists. On the
left these are Motivation, Strategy and Business specialists. On the right these
are Data, Application and Technology specialists. These specialist roles
conveniently match the ArchiMate layers.

## TOGAF defined Architect roles

### Chief architect

[work in progress]

### Enterprise architect

[work in progress]

### Segment architect

[work in progress]

Large enterprises have domain architects that handle segments of the enterprise
architecture and work on the same layers as an enterprise architect.

## Solution architect

[work in progress]

Solution architects usually focus on the solutions that are modeled on the
application layer. This often requires small changes to the business and the
technology layers as well.

## Specialists on Motivation, Strategy and Business

### Business Security Architect

[work in progress]

Security architects often use the strategy and business layer to model security
frameworks. Specific security elements, such as risk and security principles are
often used to model enterprise security risk management by relating the security
elements to services on the business, application and technology layers.

## Specialists on Data, Application and Technology

### Technical Security Architect

### Infrastructure architect

[work in progress]

Infrastructure architects add detail to the technology layer.
