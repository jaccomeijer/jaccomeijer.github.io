## Who uses ArchiMate?

The post below talks about who uses ArchiMate. The short answer here is IT
architects. The long answer is in this post.

## IT Architects

This list of IT architect roles is long. This post started with the Chief,
Enterprise and Solutions roles in mind but the list is longer. Time for a quick
ArchiMate model.

## The model

From an ArchiMate perspective, the roles could be simple. A strategy architect, a
business architect, an application architect and a technology architect. The
strategy architect overseeing the full architecture.

In real life, IT architect roles do not follow this ArchiMate abstraction. Many
roles exist and depending on the context the expected activities vary.

This post uses the example roles from the TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills
Guide. This guide uses the three TOGAF viewpoints for managing an enterprise
architecture landscape to describe Architect roles. The viewpoints are:

- A complete **enterprise** and its overall structure
- Specific **segments** (relevant elements) of the enterprise that have
  coherence and can be governed and evolved effectively
- Specific **solutions** that utilize the components within the segments to
  remove, change, or introduce new solutions and their associated sub-systems,
  systems, and services

The model below relates these viewpoints to the the four TOGAF defined Architect
roles: Chief, Enterprise, Segment and Solutions Architect.

## Specialists

Besides the four TOGAF defined Architect roles, the segments viewpoint shows two
groups of specialists. Business specialists on the left and Data, Application
and Technology specialists on the right.

The model divides the Business specialists into Motivation, Strategy and
Business so that these specialists match the ArchiMate layers.

The two specialist groups come from the TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills
Guide. Modeling the many architect roles like this gives them a clear
organizational context.

## TOGAF defined roles

Full description of the roles are in the TOGAF Architecture Roles and Skills
Guide. Here's a brief summary.

### Chief architect

Chief architects communicate concepts and ideas to all executives and are
responsible for gaining commitment. They lead enterprise, segment and solution
architects as well as the various specialists in delivering services and
solutions.

### Enterprise architect

Enterprise architects work with senior stakeholders to ensure delivering
services and solutions. They define architectural principles and oversee governance.

### Segment architect

Large enterprises have segment architects that handle segments of the enterprise
architecture.

They are responsible for the capabilities of a segment and collaborate with
solution architects and specialists. Segment architects ensure compliance and
alignment with business goals.

### Solution architect

Solution architects are responsible for delivering capabilities and collaborate
with business and specialist stakeholders. They design and govern solutions
based on specific requirements and ensure desired business outcomes. Solution
architects oversee architectural and solution building blocks.
