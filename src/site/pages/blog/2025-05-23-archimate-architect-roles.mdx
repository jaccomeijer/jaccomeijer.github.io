## Who uses ArchiMate?

The post below talkes about who uses ArchiMate. The short answer here is IT
architects. The long answer is in this post.

## IT Architects

This list of IT architect roles is long. This post started with the Enterprise,
Solutions, and Infrastructure roles in mind but the list is a lot
longer. That required a quick model.


## The model

From an ArchiMate perspective, the roles could be simple. A strategy architect, a
business architect, an application architect and a technology architect. The
strategy architect overseeing the full architecture.

In real life, IT architect roles do not follow this ArchiMate abstraction. The
model below shows an interpretation of how some of the most common IT architect
roles can be mapped to the layers.

## The roles

[Work In Progress]

All architects in a team use the motivation elements that drive the design of an
enterprise. The motivation stack contains elements like requirements, principles
and drivers.

### Enterprise architects
Enterprise architects model the full enterprise and operate on all layers. The
application and interface layer are modeled as abstract views which means that
e.g. solutions are modeled but without any detail.

### Domain architects
Large enterprises have domain architects that handle segments of the enterprise
architecture and work on the same layers as an enterprise architect.

### Security architects
Security architects often use the strategy and business layer to model security
frameworks. Specific security elements, such as risk and security principles are
often used to model enterprise security risk management by relating the security
elements to services on the business, application and technology layers.

### Solution architects
Solution architects usually focus on the solutions that are modeled on the
application layer. This often requires small changes to the business and the
technology layers as well.

### Infrastructure architects
Infrastructure architects add detail to the technology layer.
