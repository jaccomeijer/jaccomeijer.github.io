## Render JSX plugin for Esbuild

The last post showed a simple plugin for [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io).

<Topic
  variant="card"
  topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'render-jsx-plugin')}
  swapImage={true}
/>

## Enhanced plugin

This plugin was enhanced with a few lines of code to support Front Matter, CSS
bundles and images. The enhanced plugin was used to create a small JSX UI
library known as Green Lib.

## Eleventy MDX

Once [MDX became a supported template
language](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/mdx/) for Eleventy, the enhanced
plugin was of little use anymore and all content was migrated to a Eleventy
setup. The Green Lib survived this migration.

## Green Lib

The library [documents each compontent](https://jaccomeijer.nl/green-lib) with a
MDX document. Very simular - but much simpler - to tools like
[Stoybook](https://storybook.js.org).

A [quick reference implementation](https://www.jaccomeijer.nl/reference) shows
the library capabilities. It simply renders all components.

## Fast evolving CSS

This post is part of a series that originated with the question "can the
Contentful-Gatsby-Netlify trio be simplified?".

The original idea to put this trio together goes back to 2018. Six years later,
much has changed in the world of CSS.

### CSS Specificity

A classic CSS challenge is CSS specificity. The selector with the highest
specificity value wins. Inline styles have a specificity of 1000 which could
only be overridden by the `!important` rule. Lots of fun!

This challenge resulted in theories like the [Inverted Triangle
CSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/).

<Topic variant="quote" topic={props.itcssTopic} />

Similar concepts to manage specificity are in this library. The structure
(objects) and utility classes have a lot in common with ITCSS.

### CSS Cascade Layers

The `@layer` rule added in 2022 greatly improved managing specificity. When
importing CSS like this:

```css
@import './css/global/reset.css' layer(reset);
@import './css/global/markdown.css' layer(markdown);
@import './bundles/css/structures.css' layer(structures);
@import './bundles/css/components.css' layer(components);
@import './bundles/css/utilities.css' layer(utilities);
```

Specificity can be managed like this:

```css
@layer reset, markdown, structures, components, ce, utilities, custom;
```

CSS on the custom layer will always override CSS on the layers below. This is a
great way to manage the cascade. No need for the `!important` rule anymore!

### :is and :where

A concise way of writing rules and more control over specificity:

- `:is(list)` → specificity is set to the most specific selector in the list
- `:where(list)` → removes specificity for all selectors in the list

### Clamp

Clamp is another useful addition to modern CSS. Amongst many things, it allows
for dynamic font and space scales. This library uses scales generated at
[Utopia](https://utopia.fyi).

### Design tokens and CSS Custom Properties

Space scales are added to the project by using design tokens.

Design tokens allow for importing things like colors and spaces from Figma
directly into CSS. This library uses the
[design-tokens-cli](https://github.com/Heydon/design-tokens-cli) package to
covert Design Tokens to CSS Custom Properties.

More on that at
the [W3C Design tokens community
group](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/). This is the [latest version
of the spec](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/).

### Eslint v9

Not a CSS improvement, but working with JSX, a relevant change in the landscape.
[Eslint](https://eslint.org) finally decided on a new eslint config format
called `flat config`. The VSCode Eslint plugin has a `Experimental: Use Flat
Config` flag which makes the plugin work with the new (greatly improved!)
config.

### Native Nested CSS

The list of CSS improvements is long. Nested CSS is natively supported by all
major browsers. No more need for a CSS preprocessor to use this.

### Container queries

Another interesting addition is what is named 'container queries'. When
defining:

```css
.parent {
  container-type: inline-size;
}
```

Children of this parent can use:

```css
@container (min-width: 700px) {
  .child h3 {
    font-size: 2em;
  }
}
```

This gives a lot more control than the existing media queries.

## Web components

By experiment, two components in the library have been set up as Custom Elements
with isolated shadow DOM. The components were elected because they require
Javascript to function.

- [navigation-header](https://www.jaccomeijer.nl/green-lib/components/navigation-header),
  uses Javascript to open the mobile menu
- [carousel-layout](https://www.jaccomeijer.nl/green-lib/components/carousel-layout),
  uses Javascript to scroll the slides

This works well, but faces all the problems of styling Custom Elements.

> NOTE: Zach Leatherman, author of 11ty, wrote [a great
> post](https://www.zachleat.com/web/styling-web-components/) on the modern
> issues of styling Custom Elements.

The library produces one CSS bundle which can be reused in the Custom Element.
Because the browser caches the bundle, it will not be downloaded twice. Still,
this solution is not perfect. As outlined by Zach in the post mentioned above.

### Declarative Shadow Dom

Since Feb 20, 2024 all major browsers support 'Declarative Shadow Dom'. The
declarative part means that 'Shadow Dom' can be enabled without Javascript:

```html
<template shadowrootmode="open"></template>
```

This brings the advantages of isolating Javascript and styling. Obviously,
isolation makes [sharing styles](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-shadow-parts-1/)
harder.

## React build

The [current library](https://jaccomeijer.nl/green-lib) is simply part of the
site build and MDX imports are like this:

```js
import { Topic } from '../../../green-lib/components/topic/topic'
```

The library can easily  be turned into a React npm package. Enabling reuse and
verioning. Imprting would then be:

```js
import { Topic } from '@jaccomeijer/green-lib/react'
```

Using the first import, a bundle could be created for e.g. Preact or another JSX
Factory. The second is useful for frameworks like [NextJs](https://nextjs.org)
and [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Conclusion

Setting up the library was straightforward because of the simplicity and speed
of Esbuild. Having a MDX document right next to the CSS provides for a quick way
to draft up a component. It's like developing a library with a UI Storybook
built-in.

Adding a React bundle to the library makes it more universal. The library can
then be used in React projects and MDX environments.

Nested CSS, Container queries, CSS Layers, etc., the list of CSS improvement in
the last six years is long. This improves the Developer Experience. CSS Layers
for example, are clearly visible in the development tools of a modern browser. A
major improvement over guessing the specificity of a selector in the old days.

### Github

This site, the library [reference
implementation](https://jaccomeijer.nl/reference) and the [ui library
itself](https://www.jaccomeijer.nl/green-lib) are all in [one
repository](https://github.com/jaccomeijer/jaccomeijer.github.io) for
simplicity.
