# DRAFT

## Threat modeling

Threat modeling originates from organizations that need to manage risk. To
understand the context of threat modeling and how it fits into ISO 27001 and
NIST CSF the risk managing concept is needed.

## Managing risk

Risk is a broad area and in the context of risk management, risk relates to
threats, vulnerabilities and assets.

For an organization to manage risk, risks need to be identified. Once
identified, risk is analyzed in depth.

Larger organizations manage risk by identifying as much risk at the same time
while small and medium sized businesses usually start with the first risk
identified.

Risk analysis is analyzing threats, vulnerabilities and assets. Threat modeling
being part of threat analysis.

From risk analysis, risk is evaluated by looking at likelihood and impact of the
risk. Likelihood is the probability that a threat exploits a vulnerability and
impact is the possible asset value loss. In a quantitative way when measured in
currency and in a qualitative way when evaluating importance.

Once inherent risk is evaluated, it is treated and residual risk remains. The
table below shows a high level overview.

| Evaluation                                                   | Treatment | How                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk exceeds a threshold                                     | Avoid     | Stop using a specific technology or behavior                 |
| Likelihood or impact can be reduced with cost effective measures | Mitigate  | Implement controls                                           |
| Mitigation is not cost effective                               | Transfer  | Shift risk onto a 3rd party by e.g. insurance or cloud services |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost effective                 | Accept    | Be aware                                                     |

### Frameworks for managing risk 

ISO 31000 is a guideline for managing risk and details a process, principles and
a framework. It is a common framework that does not address specific industry or
regulation needs.

For cyber security specifically, NIST SP 800-37 is a risk management framework
for information systems. Two well known guides exist on managing cyber security
risk.

- ISO 27005, provides guidance on managing information security risks, but it
does not directly provide a risk management process
- NIST 800-30, a guide for conducting risk assessments (for information security)

## NIST CSF

NIST CSF is framework for cyber security. It can be seen as a roadmap that does
not mandate the how. Literally not a risk management framework, but what does it
say about risk management?

### NIST CSF on managing risk

The first core function IDENTIFY is about the organization's current cyber
security risks. Asset management and risk management are on the roadmap here.

The core function PROTECT is about treating the risk. Based on the results of
IDENTIFY, controls are added where needed instead of the one-size-fits-all
approach.

The conclusion is that NIST CSF clearly has managing risk on the roadmap.

## ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is a management system for cyber security and just like NIST CSF, it
does not mandate the how. Like NIST CSF, not a risk management framework, but
what does it say about risk management?

### ISO 27001 on managing risk

Clause 6 starts with the requirement to implement 'Actions to address risks and opportunities'.
Which details into:

- 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment
- 6.1.3 Information security risk treatment

Two of the recommended controls are:

- 5.7 Threat intelligence
- 5.9 Inventory of information and other associated assets

The conclusion for ISO 27001 is that being certified means that managing risk
must be implemented.
