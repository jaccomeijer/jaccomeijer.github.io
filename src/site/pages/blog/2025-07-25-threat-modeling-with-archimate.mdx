| Risk treatment | When | How |
|----------------|------|-----|
| Avoid          | Risk exceeds a threshold                                          | Stop using a specific technology or behavior |
| Mitigate       | Likelihood or impact can be reduced with cost effective measures  | Implement controls |
| Transfer       | Mitigate is not cost effective                                    | Shift risk onto a 3rd party by e.g. insurance or cloud services |
| Accept         | Mitigate and transfer are not cost effective                      | Be aware |

## Risk assessment

- Identify Assets and asset value
- Threat modeling
- Vulnerability assessment
- Likelihood: probability that a threat exploit a vulnerability
- Impact is the quantitative loss measured in currency and/or qualitative loss measured in importance
