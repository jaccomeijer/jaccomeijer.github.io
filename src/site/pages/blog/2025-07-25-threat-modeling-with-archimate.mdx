## Threat modeling

Threat modeling originates from organizations that need to manage risk. To
understand the context of threat modeling and how it fits into ISO 27001 and
NIST CSF the risk managing concept is important.

## Managing risk

Risk is a broad area and in the context of risk management, risk relates to
threats, vulnerabilities and assets.

<Picture className="s-block-space u-block-space-l" src="/site/pages/blog/images-security-framework/risk.svg" />

For an organization to manage risk, risk need to be identified. Once
identified, risk can be analyzed and treated.

Larger organizations manage risk by identifying as much risk at the same time
while small and medium sized businesses usually start with the first risk
identified.

Risk analysis is analyzing threats, vulnerabilities and assets. Threat modeling
being part of threat analysis.

From risk analysis, risk is evaluated by looking at likelihood and impact of the
risk. Likelihood is the probability that a threat exploits a vulnerability and
impact is the possible asset value loss. In a quantitative way when measured in
currency and in a qualitative way when evaluating importance.

Once inherent risk is evaluated, it is treated and residual risk remains. The
table below shows a high level overview.

| Evaluation                                                   | Treatment | How                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk exceeds a threshold                                     | Avoid     | Stop using a specific technology or behavior                 |
| Likelihood or impact can be reduced with cost effective measures | Mitigate  | Implement controls                                           |
| Mitigation is not cost effective                               | Transfer  | Shift risk onto a 3rd party by e.g. insurance or cloud services |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost effective                 | Accept    | Be aware                                                     |

### Frameworks for managing risk 

The ISO 31000 family is a guideline for managing risk that details a process,
principles and a framework. It is a common framework that does not address
specific industry or regulation needs.

Specifically for cyber security, NIST SP 800-37 is a well known risk framework.
Two other notable standards for cyber security risk are not frameworks but do
provide useful guidance.

- ISO 27005, provides guidance on managing information security risks
- NIST 800-30, a guide for conducting information security risk assessments

## NIST CSF

NIST CSF is very specific for the cyber security. It is an outcome oriented
roadmap that does not mandate the how. What is on the CSF roadmap for risk
management?

### NIST CSF on managing risk

The first core function `IDENTIFY` is about the organization's current cyber
security risks. Asset management and risk management are on the roadmap here.

The core function `PROTECT` is about treating the risk. Based on the results of
`IDENTIFY`, controls are added where needed instead of the one-size-fits-all
approach.

The conclusion is that NIST CSF clearly has managing risk on the roadmap.

## ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is a management system for cyber security and just like NIST CSF, it
does not mandate the how. What does this standard say on risk management
requirements?

### ISO 27001 on managing risk

The standard requires 'Actions to address risks and opportunities' in clause 6
which details into:

- 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment
- 6.1.3 Information security risk treatment

Appendix A contains the recommended Information security controls and states
that the controls shall be used in context with information security risk
treatment (6.1.3) as mentioned above.

Two specific controls on risk management are:

- 5.7 Threat intelligence
- 5.9 Inventory of information and other associated assets

The conclusion for ISO 27001 is that managing risk is mandatory.

## Managing risk and NIST CSF and ISO 27001

As concluded in the post below, NIST CSF and ISO 27001 have a different purpose,
but their goals align and the standards complement each other well.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'iso-27001-nist-csf')} swapImage={true} />

With the post in mind, finding that risk management fits both standards equally
well does not come as a surprise. Threat modeling fits on the NIST CSF roadmap
and answers to the ISO 27001 requirements.

The post shows an Archimate diagram with ISO controls and NIST CSF core
functions. With the security frameworks modeled, threat modeling is the obvious
next step.

## Threat modeling

Threat modeling is much more a way of thinking than that it is methods or
procedures. Like DevSecOps moving away from silo's by shifting culture the
cultural change needed for threat modeling is moving from a security upfront
approach towards the awareness that new threats appear constantly.

Because of these frequent threats, managing the risk they impose is not a
trivial task. Challenging for small and medium businesses and an even more
difficult task for governments and larger enterprises.

The observatory nature of the threat modeling culture makes this task easier and
the visual nature of Enterprise Architecture (EA) helps by visualizing the
elements of risk, how the elements relate and how the elements relate to the
existing EA landscape.

> Technology changes, threats change, EA should change accordingly. Because of
the growing need for enterprise agility in the digital age [The Open
Group](https://www.opengroup.org) introduced [Open Agile
Architecture](https://www.opengroup.org/AgileArchitecture) late 2020.

### Defining threats

Depending on the context threats are commonly defined by using one of these
perspectives.

| Perspective         | Starting point for identifying threats |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Attacker            | Setup a motivation stack for possible attackers |
| Asset               | Classify assets by determining quantitative and qualitative asset value  |
| Software            | Visualize components, processes and data flows |


### Spreadsheet approach

A classic approach to threat modeling is the spreadsheet exercise. Simply add
the elements of risk, as mentioned at the start of this post, to the columns of
a spreadsheet and fill the rows with possible threats and risk treatments.

Many companies pass the ISO 27001 audit this way.

### Whiteboard approach

Another approach is the whiteboard approach where developers, IT architects and
stakeholders together identify possible threats. Once a threat is identified on
the whiteboard, the threat can be formalized and documented by adding the threat
to EA. Specific tradeoffs of treatments are added and updated when situations
change.

## EA threat modeling

Both spreadsheet and whiteboard approaches have value. It is not uncommon for
spreadsheet threat analysis to be imported into EA. The spreadsheet power of
filtering and sorting combined with the power of visualizing relations in EA are
both useful for analyzing threats.

Both ways of threat modeling increase the maturity of managing cyber security in
many ways. The NIST CSF tiers make this clear.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'csf-tiers-for-cyber-security-risk-governance-and-management')} swapImage={true} />

A threat modeling culture combined with EA adds to awareness, adds to formally
sharing security details, adds its share to consistent methods and when threat
modeling becomes a recurring task – as it should be – the activity adds to the
feedback loop as described in the fourth NIST CSF tier.

### EA threat modeling meta model

A simple example diagram on how threats can be modeled using Archimate. The
diagram contains the specializations from the post below.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'iso-risk-assessment-elements')} swapImage={true} />

The model contains a few simple application elements and shows how these relate
to a security control measure, a security principle and a security goal.

The red elements in the diagram represent the threat modeling.

## Tooling

Many tools for threat modeling exist. Below is an example threat model
distributed with the free [OWASP](https://owasp.org) tool called Threat Dragon.

Tooling can help, but a threat modeling culture should be the main goal.

## KPIs

Common practice for threat modeling is KPI monitoring. Because true value is in
the culture change a good indicator is job satisfaction for roles involved in
threat modeling. Of course, many other obvious metrics can be monitored.

## Threat modeling Resources

Common resources for threat modeling include OWASP, the Microsoft STRIDE
classification model and the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base of adversary tactics
and techniques.
