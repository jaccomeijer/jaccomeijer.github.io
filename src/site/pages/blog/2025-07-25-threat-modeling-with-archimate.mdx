## Threat modeling

Threat modeling has it roots in organizations that needed to manage risk. At first
this was military strategy and software engineering but over time it formalized
within the field of cyber security.

To understand the context of threat modeling and how it fits into ISO 27001 and
NIST CSF the risk managing concept is important.

## Managing risk

Risk is a broad area and in the context of risk management, risk relates to
threats, vulnerabilities and assets.

<Picture className="s-block-space u-block-space-l" src="/site/pages/blog/images-security-framework/risk.svg" />

For an organization to manage risk, risk need to be identified. Once
identified, risk can be analyzed and treated.

Larger organizations manage risk by identifying as much risk at the same time
while small and medium sized businesses usually start with the first risk
identified.

Risk analysis is analyzing threats, vulnerabilities and assets. Threat modeling
being part of threat analysis.

From risk analysis, risk is evaluated by looking at likelihood and impact of the
risk. Likelihood is the probability that a threat exploits a vulnerability and
impact is the possible asset value loss. In a quantitative way when measured in
currency and in a qualitative way when evaluating importance.

Once inherent risk is evaluated, it is treated and residual risk remains. The
table below gives a high level overview.

| Evaluation                                                   | Treatment | How                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk exceeds a threshold                                     | Avoid     | Stop using a specific technology or behavior                 |
| Likelihood or impact can be reduced with cost effective measures | Mitigate  | Implement controls                                           |
| Mitigation is not cost effective                               | Transfer  | Shift risk onto a 3rd party by e.g. insurance or cloud services |
| Mitigation and transfer are not cost effective                 | Accept    | Be aware                                                     |

### Frameworks for managing risk 

The ISO 31000 family is a guideline for managing risk that details a process,
principles and a framework. It is a framework that fits all types of industry
and is regulation independent. Many other frameworks like e.g. ISO 14971 for
medical devices address specific industry types and align with industry specific
regulation.

Specifically for cyber security, NIST SP 800-37 is a well known risk framework.
Two other notable cyber security specific risk standards are not frameworks but
do provide useful guidance.

- ISO 27005, provides guidance on managing information security risks
- NIST 800-30, a guide for conducting information security risk assessments

## NIST CSF

NIST CSF, with cyber security in it's name is specific for the field. It is an
outcome oriented roadmap that does not mandate the how. What does NIST CSF have
on the roadmap for risk management?

### Risk management and NIST CSF

The first NIST CSF core function `IDENTIFY` is about the organization's current
cyber security risks. Asset management and risk management are on the roadmap
here.

The core function `PROTECT` is about treating the risk. Based on the results of
`IDENTIFY`, controls are added where needed instead of the one-size-fits-all
approach.

As expected for a cyber security framework, NIST CSF clearly has managing risk
on the roadmap.

## ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is a management system for cyber security and just like NIST CSF,
there is no 'how'. What does it say on risk management requirements?

### Risk management and ISO 27001

ISO 27001 requires 'Actions to address risks and opportunities' in clause 6
which details to:

- 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment
- 6.1.3 Information security risk treatment

Appendix A contains the recommended Information security controls and states
that the controls shall be used in context with information security risk
treatment (6.1.3) as mentioned above.

Two specific controls on risk management are:

- 5.7 Threat intelligence
- 5.9 Inventory of information and other associated assets

As you may expect from a cyber security management framework, ISO 27001 makes
risk management mandatory.

## Managing risk and NIST CSF and ISO 27001

The post below on NIST CSF and ISO 27001 states that the standards have a
different purpose, but their goals align and the standards strengthen each
other.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'iso-27001-nist-csf')} swapImage={true} />

With that in mind, finding that risk management is part of both standards does
not come as a surprise. Threat modeling fits on the NIST CSF roadmap and answers
to the ISO 27001 requirements.

The post on NIST CSF and ISO 27001 shows an Archimate diagram and models ISO
controls and NIST CSF core functions.

With the security frameworks modeled, threat modeling is the obvious next step.

## Threat modeling

Threat modeling is much more a way of thinking than that it is methods,
techniques and tooling. Like DevSecOps moving away from silo's by shifting
culture the cultural change needed for threat modeling is moving from a security
upfront approach towards the awareness that new threats appear constantly.

Because of frequent new threats and the large attack surface, managing the risk
they impose is not a trivial task. Challenging for small and medium businesses
and an even more difficult for governments and larger enterprises.

Both the observatory nature of threat modeling and the visual nature of
Enterprise Architecture (EA) contribute to improved risk management. Threat
modeling helps by collaboratively modeling new threats and treatments. EA helps
by visualizing the elements of risk and how they relate to business goals and
the application landscape.

> Technology changes, threats change, EA should change accordingly. Because of
the growing need for enterprise agility in the digital age [The Open
Group](https://www.opengroup.org) introduced [Open Agile
Architecture](https://www.opengroup.org/AgileArchitecture) late 2020.

### Defining threats

Depending on the context threats are commonly defined by starting with one of
these three perspectives.

| Perspective         | Starting point for identifying threats |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Attacker            | Setup a motivation stack for possible attackers |
| Asset               | Classify assets by determining quantitative and qualitative asset value  |
| Software            | Visualize components, processes and data flows |


### Spreadsheet approach

A classic approach to threat modeling is the spreadsheet exercise. Simply add
the elements of risk, as mentioned at the start of this post, to the columns of
a spreadsheet and fill the rows with possible threats and risk treatments.

For many companies these spreadsheets are part of passing an ISO 27001 audit.

### Whiteboard approach

More in depth is the whiteboard approach where developers, IT architects and
stakeholders together identify threats and compose possible treatments. Once a
threat is identified on the whiteboard, the threat can be formalized and
documented by adding the threat to EA. Specific tradeoffs of treatments are
added and updated when situations change.

## EA threat modeling

Both spreadsheet and whiteboard approaches have value. It is not uncommon for
spreadsheet threat analysis to be imported into EA. The spreadsheet power of
filtering and sorting combined with the holistic view of EA are both useful for
analyzing threats.

Both ways of threat modeling increase the maturity of managing cyber security in
many ways. As becomes clear from the NIST CSF defined tiers.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'csf-tiers-for-cyber-security-risk-governance-and-management')} swapImage={true} />

A threat modeling culture combined with EA adds to awareness and to formally
sharing security details. It adds to consistent methods and when threat modeling
becomes part of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) the activity adds to
the feedback loop as described in the fourth NIST CSF tier.

### Archimate threat modeling meta model

The diagram below shows an Archimate threat modeling meta model.

The model shows how Architecture Building Blocks (ABB), Solution Building Blocks
(SBB) relate to security control measures, security principles and a security
goals. The red elements represent the threat modeling.

Threat modeling can likewise be applied to services on the other layers
providing a holistic view of the organizations security risks.

> ABB and SBB as defined by TOGAF maintained by [The Open
Group](https://www.opengroup.org)

## Tooling

Many threat modeling tools exist. Below an example threat model distributed with
the free [OWASP](https://owasp.org) Threat Dragon tool.

Tooling can help, but a threat modeling culture should be the main goal.

## KPIs

Common practice for threat modeling is KPI monitoring. Because true value is in
the culture a good indicator is job satisfaction for roles involved in threat
modeling. Of course, many other obvious metrics can be monitored.

## Threat modeling Resources

Common resources for threat modeling include OWASP, the Microsoft STRIDE
classification model and the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base of adversary tactics
and techniques.

- [OWASP Threat Modeling Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-model/)
- [STRIDE Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model)
- [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org)
- NIST 800-154, guide to data centric system threat modeling
- PASTA: Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

## Conclusion

Threat modeling is a good fit for both ISO 27001 and NIST CSF standards. It
provides the context based risk management described by both standards.

The standards describe that managing security risks is a collaborative effort
and how this should be a foundational element of an organization. This
collaborative effort is at the core of the threat modeling culture.

Threat modeling helps by collaboratively modeling new threats and treatments.
The holistic view EA provides helps by visualizing the elements of risk and how
they relate to business goals, the application landscape and the technologies in
use.
