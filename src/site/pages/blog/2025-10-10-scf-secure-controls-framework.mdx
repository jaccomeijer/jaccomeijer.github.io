This post is a work in progress.

## Secure Controls Framework

The post below on how to align the steadily increasing number of security
standards refers to the [Secure Controls

about how to use the SCF canonical control objectives with Enterprise Risk and
Security Management (ERSM) in Archimate.

  'iso-27000-isa-62443-nis2-bio-nist-csf-800-53').action.url}>this post on
  security standards</a> models all elements of the SCF. Figure 1 shows an
updated version of the same model where all technology elements are moved to the
bottom of the model.
