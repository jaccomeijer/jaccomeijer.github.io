## IT Architecture languages

UML, C4 and ArchiMate all three can be used for visualizing IT Architecture.
This does however not mean that they are equal. Each of the languages was
designed for a specific need.

UML originated in 1994 because there was a need to describe object-oriented
software. In 2006 the need for more structure than the UML arrows and boxes
resulted in the C4 language.

In 2002 ArchiMate development started because of the need for a language to
describe an enterprise.

From an ArchiMate perspective C4 defines a number of viewpoints.

## UML

UML was designed to be a general-purpose modeling language for visualizing
system design. It provides a language for many types of diagrams including
behavior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams.

UML is said to be decreasing in popularity (source: Google Trends) but the
language being around for more than 30 years and it's general-purpose nature
make that it's use is still widespread.

### Commonly used

As mentioned, the use of UML is widespread. Activity Diagrams are well known for
visualizing system flows. Within software development these diagrams are often
used:

- **use case diagrams**, for interactions between actors;
- **class diagrams**, for class relationships, attributes and methods;
- **sequence diagrams**, for a sequence of messages between participants.

## C4

The C4 language was designed to be easy to learn and developer friendly. It
reaches that goal by focussing on clarity and simplicity.

From the C4 documentation:

> A **software system** is made up of one or more **containers** (applications
and data stores), each of which contains one or more **components**, which in
turn are implemented by one or more **code** elements (classes, interfaces,
objects, functions, etc).

The four emphasized words in this one sentence correspond to the four static
structure diagrams that define the core of C4.

1. (system) context diagram
2. container diagram
3. component diagram
4. code diagram

Additionally there's three more diagrams:

5. system landscape diagram
6. dynamic diagram
7. deployment diagram

But that's it. Simple to use and easy to learn.

### Commonly used

C4 being specifically designed for software architecture it is mainly used by
solution and software architects. Security and enterprise architects tend to
choose for ArchiMate instead because of the limited C4 set of elements.

## ArchiMate

From the three languages UML defines more than 100 elements. C4 is a lot simpler
with no more than 10 elements. The 3.1 Specification of ArchiMate counts around
60 elements.

One of the design goals was to make ArchiMate 'as small as possible'. As in, the
goal was not to cover every possible edge.

### C4 compared to ArchiMate

C4 can be seen as a subset of ArchiMate, the C4 diagrams can be expressed with
the Archimage viewpoint concept. Depending on how you look at it, the C4
elements can be mapped in a couple of ways to ArchiMate elements.

The C4 'System' element is described as something that delivers value to users.
ArchiMate defines a 'Value Stream' element which describes behavior on the
strategy layer. But since C4 also defines a 'System' as something a single
software development team is building, the 'Application Function' or
'Application component' element would be a better fit.

The C4 'Container' element is describes as something that needs to be running
for the system to work. The ArchiMate 'Application Component' element could be
used to express this. 

The C4 documentation states that a 'Component' is a "hugely overloaded term".
It's true, the word component can be used in many different ways. C4 defines it
as 'grouping of related functionality encapsulated behind a well-defined
interface'. This could be an ArchiMate 'Application Component' or 'Application
Service' element. The 'well-defined interface' can be modelled separately in
ArchiMate by using the 'Application Interface' element.

The C4 element 'Code' is hard to model in ArchiMate. The 'Application Component'
element can be used to express a software library and the 'Data Object' element
can be used, but concepts like 'classes', 'attributes' and 'methods' are not
available. The 'Application Component' element can be used for this if you
really have to, but UML and C4 are a much better suited for this.

Simply put, all C4 elements can be expressed by ArchiMate 'Application
Component' elements. It makes clear how C4 and ArchiMate differ. C4 defines four
sizes of 'Application Components' whereas ArchiMate has nine different
'Application' elements like 'Interface', 'Function' and 'Service' that can be
used to add more detail.

Besides the 'Application' layer, ArchiMate defines five other layers and uses
Motivation elements for modelling motivations.


## Structure as code

All three languages have code equivalents. PlantUml being the most popular. It
can be extended to support the ArchiMate and C4 languages by using macro
libraries.
