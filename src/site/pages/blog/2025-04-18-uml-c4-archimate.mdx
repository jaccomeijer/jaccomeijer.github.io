## IT Architecture languages

UML, C4 and Archimate can all be used for visualizing IT Architecture but yet
the languages are very different.

The oldest language is UML. It originates from 1994 and is the most generic of
the three. C4 development started in 2006 and was specifically designed for
modelling the architecture of software systems. Archimate development started in
2002 and distinguishes itself by being able to model enterprise architecture.

### UML

UML was designed to be a general-purpose modeling language for visualizing
system design. It provides a language for many types of diagrams including
behavior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams.

UML is said to be decreasing in popularity (source: Google Trends) but the
language being around for more than 30 years and it's general-purpose nature
make that it's use is still widespread.

#### Common use

UML is often used in software development for visualizing system design and
behavior. Three diagrams in particular are often used:

- **use case diagrams**, for interactions between actors;
- **class diagrams**, for class relationships, attributes and methods;
- **sequence diagrams**, for a sequence of messages between participants.
