## Workspaces

Within a code repository, workspaces are a way of separating NodeJs projects.

In 2017 the [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) project provided a clear monorepo
workflow for [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
Shortly after the release of Lerna v1.0, Yarn introduced 'workspaces' and four
years later also Npm added the 'workspaces' feature.

### Arborist

Npm v7 under the hood uses
[@npmcli/arborist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@npmcli/arborist) to handle the
workspaces. It is a powerful library that can be used independently of NPM.

### Jmmake

Over the years the Lerna project grew and gained many options. These options
were required to handle all the different use cases.

Most of our projects however, required only a subset of what Lerna has to offer.
This resulted in a little custom build tool named Jmmake (not online anymore).

#### Versioning

Jmmake uses a very specific versioning scheme. Bottom line is that the root
package version is always leading when bumping the version.

#### Build, publish and release

Besides managing the version, the tool allows for:

- running **npm run build** for each package
- publish the packages to a repository
- create a Github release

### Roll you own

The tool is not meant to be a generic solution for everyone. Lerna already is.
The project showed how easy it is to create your own build tool that does
exactly what you want. The Arborist package does the heavy lifting.

When you're interested in the source - it's not maintained anymore - reach out
for an archived copy.

With the library functions as a base, rolling your own is simple!
