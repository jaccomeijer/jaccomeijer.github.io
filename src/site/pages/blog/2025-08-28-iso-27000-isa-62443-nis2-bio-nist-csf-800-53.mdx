## NIST CSF Categories

The post below on NIST CSF and ISO 27001 states that the standards have
different purposes, but their goals align and the standards strengthen each
other.

<Topic variant="card" topic={blogOpenerByNavId(props, 'iso-27001-nist-csf')} swapImage={true} />

The two are relatively easy to compare and can both be used independently of the
country. For a specific country a framework or standard must commonly align with
local regulations. When the scope is extended from IT to OT, the list of
frameworks, standards and regulations becomes even longer.

This post uses the Netherlands as an example and includes IT as well as OT. In
the Netherlands it is common to work with many standards, frameworks and
regulations. Below a quite common set.

- ISO 27000 family
- NIST CSF
- NIST SP 800-53
- ISA/IEC 62443
- NIS2 Directive
- BIO (Government Information Security Baseline)


## ISO 27001 - Standard
- Standard | IT → Both

ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for establishing, implementing,
maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System
(ISMS). It is certifiable and risk-based.

applied to IT information systems, but because it scopes “information” broadly
and is risk-based, it can cover OT environments as well—organizations often
certify the enterprise ISMS and then reference OT-specific control sets (e.g.,
IEC/ISA 62443) for industrial sites.

## ISO 27002 - Standard
- Standard | IT → Both

ISO/IEC 27002 provides guidance on the implementation of controls listed in
ISO27001. It is not certifiable and serves as a supporting standard.

IT-oriented but applicable to “information security” in general; in OT
programs it’s commonly complemented by ISA/IEC 62443 where more specific
industrial control requirements are needed. The ISA Global Cybersecurity
Alliance explicitly shows how 62443 refines 27002 recommendations for
OT.


## NIST CSF 2.0 - Framework
- Framework | Both (sector-agnostic)

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) version 2.0 is a voluntary framework
designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. It
emphasizes outcomes and governance, not prescriptive controls.

regardless of size/sector; widely used for both IT and OT risk management, with
the new GOVERN function emphasizing enterprise governance across domains. Many
OT teams pair CSF with 62443 (or with SP 800-82) to realize control-level depth.


## NIST SP 800-53 - Standard
- Standard | IT → Both (with OT overlays/tailoring)

This is a U.S. federal standard that provides a comprehensive catalog of
security and privacy controls. It is often used as a baseline for compliance in
government and regulated sectors.

on IT (U.S. federal and beyond) but explicitly designed to be tailored. For
OT/ICS, NIST provides guidance in SP 800-82 (OT Security) and overlays to adapt
800-53 controls to industrial environments (e.g., ICS overlay).


## ISA/IEC 62443-2-1 - Standard
- Standard | OT (IACS)

Part of the ISA/IEC 62443 series, this standard defines security program
requirements for industrial automation and control system (IACS) asset owners.
It is certifiable and widely used in operational technology environments.

requirements for IACS asset owners; this is the canonical OT governance/process
standard across industrial sectors, complementing 62443-3-3/4-x technical
requirements.


## NIS2 Directive - Regulation
- Regulation (Directive) | Both (many OT-heavy sectors)

The NIS2 Directive is a binding EU regulation that mandates cybersecurity
requirements for essential and important entities. It is legally enforceable and
must be implemented by member states.

Member States to impose cybersecurity obligations across essential and important
entities in sectors such as energy, transport, water, health, digital
infrastructure and public administration—many of which are OT-heavy.

## BIO (Netherlands) - Framework + Regulation  
- Framework / mandatory baseline for Dutch government | Primarily IT (can extend to OT in public infrastructure contexts)

The BIO (Baseline Information Security for Government) is a national framework
aligned with ISO 27001/27002. With the upcoming Cyberbeveiligingswet (Cbw), BIO2
will become a legal requirement, making it both a framework and regulation.

mandatory baseline framework aligning with ISO 27001/27002 (2022/2023) and
updated to reflect NIS2. It primarily addresses IT information systems, but
public bodies that operate OT (e.g., water boards, infrastructure) typically
apply BIO governance while bringing in 62443 for OT specifics.
