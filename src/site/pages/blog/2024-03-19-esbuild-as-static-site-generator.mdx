## 11ty and Github pages

The last post summarized how the Contentful-Gatsby-Netlify trio could be
simplified by using Github pages and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev).

This post continues the quest for simplicity from there.

The proposition is, if only [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) can be used to
generate static HTML, this would be even simpler than using 11ty.

## Javascript bundler landscape

Nobody really liked solving the Webpack and Babel configuration puzzles.
Occasionally they blocked the actual project.

The bundler landscape matured with the rise of Parcel and Rollup and in 2020
Evan Wallace, one of the co-founders of Figma, released Esbuild.

Written in Go and 100 times faster than Webpack it is a welcome addition to the
Javascript bundler landscape

## Esbuild

Esbuild supports TypeScript, JSX and tree-shaking. Besides that, Esbuild
contains a live reloading webserver that triggers a full rebuild on a browser
refresh.

Esbuild generates Javascript bundles but a static site generator generates HTML.
The extensible nature of Esbuild allows for a simple plugin to take care of
transforming the final bundle to HTML.

## MDX

Setting up `Esbuild` and `@mdx-js/esbuild` is straightforward and [clearly
explained](https://mdxjs.com/packages/esbuild/) on mdxjs.com.

This Esbuild/MDX setup makes Esbuild transform MDX to JSX/Javascript bundles.
Additional functionality can be added by using plugins from the rich MDX
ecosystem. The example below shows how to add support for:

- Front Matter (as described in previous post)
- Code highlighting
- GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec

```js
import mdx from '@mdx-js/esbuild'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter'
import remarkMdxFrontmatter from 'remark-mdx-frontmatter'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'

const plugins = [
  mdx({
    jsxImportSource: 'preact',
    remarkPlugins: [
      [remarkGfm],
      [remarkFrontmatter, ['yaml', 'toml']],
      [remarkMdxFrontmatter, { name: 'frontmatter' }],
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight],
  }),
]
```

## Live reloading webserver

Setting up the Esbuild webserver is [explained
here](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#live-reload). For live reloading a line of
Javascript must be added to the page template.

Using Javascript the Esbuild webserver is started like this:

```js
const ctx = await esbuild.context({
  entryPoints: ['index'],
  format: 'esm',
  outdir: 'build',
  plugins: [
    mdx({
      /** options **/
    }),
  ],
})

await ctx.watch()
const { port } = await ctx.serve({ servedir: 'build' })

console.log(`Live reload server started at http://localhost:${port}\n`)
```

## Conclusion

Esbuild is a fantastic tool. It is fast, capable and extendable. With
'something' that renders JSX bundles to static HTML Esbuild could act as a
simple static site generator.

## JSX Render plugin

The 'something' from the last paragraph is described as a 'JSX Render plugin'.
This plugin must transform generated Javascript bundles to HTML pages.

More on that in the next post.
