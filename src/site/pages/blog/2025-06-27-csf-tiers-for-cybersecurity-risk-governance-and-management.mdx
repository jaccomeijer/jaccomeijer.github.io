## NIST CSF Categories

The post below about combining ISO 27001 and NIST CSF shows an Enterprise
Architecture (EA) model that maps the two standards.

One of the advantages of NIST CSF is a well known set of categories that are
useful as Enterprise Architecture (EA) business functions. This post is about
the Maturity Model that NIST CSF describes as Tiers which can be used to
classify the maturity of e.g. these business functions.

## NIST CSF tiers

The full descriptions of the tiers is found in Appendix B of NIST CSF. Below is
a brief summary that gives a quick overview.

| Tier | Name          | Risk Governance              | Risk Management                              |
|:----:|:-------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| 1    | Partial       | Ad hoc                       | Ad hoc                                       |
| 2    | Risk Informed | Adds management approval     | Adds awareness and sharing on informal basis |
| 3    | Repeatable    | Adds company wide policy     | Adds consistent methods                      |
| 4    | Adaptive      | Adds company culture         | Adds feedback loop                           |

The well known nature of the framework and the clear descriptions it provides is
a major advantage over defining your own. As with many other maturity models,
the model goes from the ad hoc state to a state that is continuously improving
from experience.

The tiers explicitly being designed for cyber security make them a valuable
benchmark for this specific field.

## NIST CSF profiles

Related to the tiers, the NIST CSF defines the concept of profiles. From an EA
perspective the CSF **current profile** corresponds to **as is** and the CSF
**target profile** corresponds to **to be**.

The tiers are useful for defining a baseline **as is** or **to be** models and
can be customized where needed.

## Enterprise Architecture

Within EA the tiers are generally used by applying a metric to an element. The
diagram below shows color coded capabilities for the four tiers.

### NIST CSF tiers on CSF Categories

Using the color coded tiers on the CSF core functions and mid-level categories
results in a diagram like the example below. This provides an organization with
clear overview of the status of cyber security risk governance and management.

## Conclusion

NIST CSF tiers are a useful way to complement an organization's cyber security
risk management methodology. The tiers can be used as a benchmark and when risks
for an organization increase, part of the strategy can be moving up to a higher
tier.

For organizations that are ISO 27001 certified and willing to adopt the tiers,
the post below is about how ISO 27001 and NIST CSF can be combined.
