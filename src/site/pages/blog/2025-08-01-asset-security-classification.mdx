## What is an asset

- asset: all sources of value
- Data -> classify and categorize classification
- Assets -> classify on asset value

## Why classify assets

Cost efficient:
- sensitive assets 
- public assets
- differentiate approach

Best practice to classify data

Most formalized in:
- military
- government
- banks

## Asset classification

## What is Classification

- identification: the more you know of an asset the better you can protect them
- classification: sensitivity labels, essential step in securing systems and data
- categorization is grouping classification


## Classification types

|  Classification Type  |  Description  |  Examples  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Content-Based**     | Analyzes the actual data within the file or message.         | Detects credit card numbers, PII, or sensitive keywords in documents. |
| **Context-Based**     | Uses metadata or environmental factors around the data.      | Classifies based on file location, sender/receiver, or access patterns. |
| **User-Based**        | Relies on user roles, behavior, or manual input.             | User selects classification label; defaults based on department or role. |


## AI Prompt: Asset Classification Levels

AI good for scaffolding, lets create classification levels


```md
create an Asset classification levels table:
- rules:
  - use tiers where tier 0 is the most restricted
  - include mixed tier
  - include example systems and devices
  - include desciption
  - include requirements
  - output visual markdown table
```

### Response: Asset classification levels

| Tier | Description | Example Systems/Devices | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | Most restricted. Critical assets with highest confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs. | Core banking systems, encryption key vaults, national ID databases | Multi-factor authentication, Strict access control, Real-time monitoring, Encrypted storage |
| Tier 1 | Highly sensitive. Important for business continuity and compliance. | HR systems, financial reporting tools, internal legal databases | Role-based access, Regular audits, Secure backups, Patch management |
| Tier 2 | Moderately sensitive. Operational systems with limited exposure risk. | CRM platforms, internal collaboration tools, inventory systems | Standard authentication, Periodic vulnerability scans, User training |
| Tier 3 | Low sensitivity. Public-facing or non-critical systems. | Company website, marketing tools, public documentation portals | Basic security hygiene, Monitoring for anomalies, Regular updates |
| Mixed Tier | Assets spanning multiple tiers due to integrated functions or shared infrastructure. | Hybrid cloud environments, shared databases, mobile device fleets | Segmentation controls, Tier-specific policies per component, Continuous risk assessment |


## How organizations classify

Key regulations and frameworks define how organizations must classify and categorize information assets, often shaping their asset identification and protection policies.

### Prompt: Regulations Matrix

```md
create a matrix:
- rows:
  - GPDR (EU)
  - NIS 2 (EU)
  - NIST SP 800-60 (USA)
  - FIPS 199 (USA)
  - FISMA (USA)
  - MLPS (CHINA)
  - PIPL (CHINA)
- columns:
  - classify
  - category
- cells: summarized search results in text 
- rules:
  - generate 5 variants for each term and log them
  - also search for variants
  - limit search to official regulation text
  - output markdown table that can be copied
```

#### Asset classification and categorization regulations

|  Framework                 |  **Classify**                                                                              |  **Category**                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **GDPR (EU)**             |  Used in guidance for security levels (e.g., EU RESTRICTED), not in the core regulation.  |  Defines “special categories” of sensitive personal data (e.g., health, race).                 |
|  **NIS 2 (EU)**            |  Refers to classifying entities by criticality (essential vs. important).                 |  Entities are grouped into categories that determine obligations and oversight.                |
|  **NIST SP 800-60 (USA)**  |  Implies classification through mapping data to impact levels.                         |  Central concept: categorizing data by confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.   |
|  **FIPS 199 (USA)**        |  Classification not used; focuses on categorizing systems by impact on security objectives.  |  Defines categories based on impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.   |
|  **FISMA (USA)**           |  Requires categorization of systems; relies on NIST guidance, not classification terminology.  |  Uses security categories to guide risk management and control selection.                      |
|  **MLPS (CHINA)**          |  Uses formal classification levels (1–5) based on system sensitivity and national interest.  |  Categorizes systems by role and criticality to determine protection requirements.             |
|  **PIPL (CHINA)**          |  Implies classification via “sensitive personal information” requiring stricter handling.  |  Defines categories of personal data, especially sensitive types like biometrics and health data.  |
