## Component?

Theoretically, everything can be a component. This is why for describing code,
the word component is too implicit.

<Topic variant="quote" topic={props.topics.zenOfPython} />

The Zen of Python states "Explicit is better than implicit". Something more
explicit than the word component describes code better. This results in clearer
code and eventually in better code architecture. Overall this improves developer
communication.

Below a React component scoping scheme that was created with the Zen of Python
in mind.

## Component scopes

### Element scope

Elements are the smallest components. The name is derived from the HTML
standard. An element receives data by passing children.

```html
<Heading>This is the hading</Heading>
<Abstract>This is the abstract</Abstract>
<button>Press me</button>
```

### Model scope

Models contain elements. This is the level where visual components meet data
models. A model receives data by passing data to the 'model' attribute.

```html
<Topic model="{topic}" />
<Navigation model="{navigation}" />
<Action model="{action}" />
<Media model="{media}" />
```

### Layout scope

Layouts contain Models. Layouts take care of positioning models. A layout
receives data by passing children.

```html
<OneColumnLayout>
  <SomeModel />
  <SomeModel />
</SidebarLayout>

<TwoColumnLayout>
  <Topic />
  <Topic />
</TwoColumnLayout>
```

## Case study: a page

Having clear component scopes helps in naming the components. When setting up a
page, this is how the scopes are used.

### Elements

A page requires a few typography elements like:

- Display
- Heading
- Body

### Models

The typography elements are used to create models:

- Header
- Topic
- Footer

### Layouts

The header and footer model have fixed layouts. Topic models are positioned by
using a layout:

- OneColumnSection
- TwoColumnSection

## Next

Next step in creating reusable React components is a clear component interface.
The post below is about defining such an interface.

<Topic
  variant="card"
  topic={getOpenerTopicByNavigationId({
    collections: props.collections,
    navigationId: 'typescript-interface-for-react',
  })}
/>
