## TBW

- Continue from blog on 11ty + jsx
- MD + JSX = MDX
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) + [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) + frontmatter plugin
- Esbuild has no history and is written in Go. This makes it faster than
  competitors like parcel, webpack and rollup.
- Eslint v9
  - Side project to eslint new 'flat config'
  - Enable flat config in VSCode
