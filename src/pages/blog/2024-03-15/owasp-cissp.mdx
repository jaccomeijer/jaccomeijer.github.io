## OWASP

[Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org) is an
independent organisation that publises articles on application security. Many of
the articles are recommendations and best practices.

## CISSP

A [Certified Information Security Professional
(CISSP)](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) is a well known independent
information security certification.

The CISSP Common Body of Knowlegde (CBK) defines security terms and principles
and contains many references to OWASP resources.

## OWASP Resources

This blog provides a closer look to these specific OWASP resources. Very useful
material for every (web) application developer.

Besides these resources, OWASP offers much more on application security. The
[cheat sheet series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org), of which some are
listed below, provide security best practices on many topics.
