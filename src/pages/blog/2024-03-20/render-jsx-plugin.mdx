## Esbuild as a static site generator for MDX

This post is part of a series that originated with the question "can the
Contentful-Gatsby-Netlify trio be simplified?".

Using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) is part of the positive answer. The last
post concludes with the need for a Render JSX plugin for Esbuild.

This post starts with the code for such a plugin and describes how it works.

## The code

Below is the full plugin. It's taken from
[jaccomeijer/render-jsx-plugin-poc](https://github.com/jaccomeijer/render-jsx-plugin-poc),
a small repo that can be used to see the plugin working.

```js
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises'
import path from 'path'
import crypto from 'crypto'
import { render } from 'preact-render-to-string'

const pluginName = 'renderJsxPlugin'

export const renderJsxPlugin = ({ outdir, initialProps }) => {
  const setup = build => {
    build.onEnd(async result => {
      const metafileOutputs = Object.keys(result.metafile.outputs)

      for (const bundlePath of metafileOutputs) {
        const entryPoint = result.metafile.outputs[bundlePath].entryPoint

        if (!entryPoint) {
          continue
        }

        const { dir, name } = path.parse(entryPoint)
        const strippedDir = dir.replace('src/pages', '')
        const outputDir = path.join(outdir, strippedDir)
        const outputPath = path.join(outdir, strippedDir, `${name}.html`)

        const cacheBust = crypto.randomBytes(6).toString('hex')
        const modulePath = path.resolve(`./${bundlePath}?v=${cacheBust}`)
        const module = await import(modulePath)

        console.log(`${pluginName}: ${outputPath}`)

        // Check if the default export is a function
        if (typeof module?.default !== 'function') {
          continue
        }
        const props = Object.assign(initialProps || {})
        const html = render(module.default(props))

        await mkdir(path.resolve(outputDir), { recursive: true })
        await writeFile(path.resolve(outputPath), `<!DOCTYPE html>${html}`)
      }
    })
  }

  return { name: pluginName, setup }
}
```

## More capable version

A more capable version of the plugin is used in the
[jaccomeijer/green-build](https://github.com/jaccomeijer/green-build)
repository. That repo is used to build this site ([repository
here](https://github.com/jaccomeijer/jaccomeijer.github.io)) and adds
functionality like:

- image handling
- CSS bundling
- HTML minifying
- code highlighting
- page prop with Front Matter support
- pages prop for menu building
- cleanup of the javascript bundle
- custom urls
- index.html for all pages
- uses React JSX runtime instead or Preact 

## The breakdown

The plugin is simple and contains a few distinct steps.

### Metadata

[Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) provides `onEnd` plugins with build
metadata. The plugin starts with using `result.metafile` to get all bundle
paths.

```js
  const metafileOutputs = Object.keys(result.metafile.outputs)
```

### OutputPath

The plugin then loops through every `bundlePath` and derives an output dir and
path.

```js
const outputPath = path.join(outdir, strippedDir, `${name}.html`)
```

### Import bundle

Next, the the JSX bundle created by Esbuild is imported. Adding
`?v=${cacheBust}` to the module path prevents Node from caching the module.

```js
const modulePath = path.resolve(`./${bundlePath}?v=${cacheBust}`)
const module = await import(modulePath)
```

### Render to HTML

The last part of the plugin does the actual rendering. The plugin imports the
`render` function from Preact.

```js
import { render } from 'preact-render-to-string'
```

This means that the plugin works with bundles that have the Preact JSX Factory.
This Factory is the function that is called for every JSX element. For Esbuild,
these are the build options to build with the Preact Factory:

```js
{
  jsx: 'automatic',
  jsxImportSource: 'preact',
  ...
}
```

The imported bundle contains a JSX component that accepts props like any other
JSX function. This demo does not do much with the `initialProps`, but this is
how e.g. global metadata can be passed to all pages. The package
[jaccomeijer/green-build](https://github.com/jaccomeijer/green-build), mentioned
earlier, uses this concept.

```js
const props = Object.assign(initialProps || {})
const html = render(module.default(props))
```

### Write to file

With the static HTML, all that's left is writing the HTML to a file for the
Esbuild webserver to render.

All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration. This is not a
tag, but an id to let the browser know what to expect. This declaration is added
here.

```js
await mkdir(path.resolve(outputDir), { recursive: true })
await writeFile(path.resolve(outputPath), `<!DOCTYPE html>${html}`)
```

## JSX

The plugin above uses Preact to transform JSX into static HTML. Theoretically,
the JSX framework should not affect the final result because Factory functions
are added when bundling and removed again when rendering. In practice, there's
some differences in consistency, speed and syntax conventions.

### Jeasx

The [jsx-async-runtime](https://github.com/jeasx/jsx-async-runtime) package
contains a very simple and lightweight JSX runtime. It also contains the
`renderToString` function.

This is a very simple runtime which makes it very fast. Drawback is that spaces
in `pre` and `code` elements are not maintained properly which makes the render
unusable for code blocks.

### Preact

The
[preact-render-to-string](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-render-to-string)
package provides a `render` function that renders consistently to static HTML.

The package does not warn about React conventions like the need for `key`
attributes and is a lot faster than React's `renderToStaticMarkup`.

### React

The first version of the
[jaccomeijer/green-build](https://github.com/jaccomeijer/green-build) package
created bundles with Preact settings.

Version 2 of the build package switched to React because of compatibility.
Creating e.g. a UI library makes the library compatible with frameworks like
[Astro](https://astro.build).

Gaining React compatibility came with the cost of speed. The React Factory is
noticeably slower than the other two. Also, creating a React bundle shows all
the warnings that come with React's conventions. CamelCase attributes and `key`
attribute requirements for example.

The [react-dom/server](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) package
contains two functions:

- `renderToString` → renders to a string that can be hydrated
- `renderToStaticMarkup` → renders a non-interactive string

Of which the Static variant is the most useful here.

### Speed and other JSX Factories

As noted above, React is the slowest of the JSX Factories. For this plugin,
three JSX Factories have been tried, but many other frameworks with JSX-alike
syntax exist. To mention a few, [Million](https://million.dev),
[SolidJs](https://www.solidjs.com) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). All of them
possibly expose separate static render functionality.

## Adding Javascript

JSX is used as a simple component solution. By wrapping static HTML in a
function, this function can be reused. Simply by importing the function.
Function arguments, or 'props', make this concept dynamic.

When JSX is rendered, only the output of the JSX functions remains. This results
in static HTML.

When client side Javascript is needed, it can be added the same way that
Javascript is added to any static HTML. E.g. using a `<script>` tag.

The `declarative shadow dom` now being supported by Mozilla makes that custom
elements with isolated shadow dom can be generated without the need for
Javascript to activate the shadow dom.

## Server Side Rendering

This plugin does exactly what Server Side Rendering (SSR) does. The major
difference with e.g. React SSR is that the build this plugin provides does not
support a Javascript runtime. It provides a pure static build instead.

This means that the React API in this code doesn't work:
```js
const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
```

To use the React API, the Javascript runtime library of React must be shipped
with the static code. Besides that, once the code is loaded by the client
browser, event handlers need to be attached to the static elements. This process
is known as 'Hydration'.

This does not mean that client side Javascript cannot be used with a static
render. The UI library in the next post defines two Custom Elements that depend
on client side Javascript.

## Conclusion

A simple extension of Esbuild lays the foundation for a fast static site
generator.

JSX being just functions, they are easily added to NPM modules for distribution
and reuse. MDX is an efficient way to write documentation and stories. Combine
the two and creating a reusable and documented UI library is simple. The next
post zooms in on this.
