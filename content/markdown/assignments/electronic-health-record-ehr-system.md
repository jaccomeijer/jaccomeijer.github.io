# New system for an old problem

This new EHR system uses [Nuts](https://nuts.nl/) as the trust layer. [HL7
FHIR](http://fhir.org/) is used to store health care data.

The architecture is defined by [eOverdracht
4.0-RC10](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/vpk:V4.0%5FFHIR%5FeOverdracht).
The assignment involved testing with other vendors like Nedap, Tenzinger and
PinkRoccade.
